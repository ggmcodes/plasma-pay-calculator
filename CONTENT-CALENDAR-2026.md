- Better to publish 20 great posts than 35 mediocre ones
- Google rewards depth and expertise

### Update as You Learn

As you publish and track results:
- Which topics perform best? Create more like that.
- Which keywords convert to clicks? Prioritize those angles.
- Which competitor angles work? Adapt those approaches.
- User feedback? Incorporate into future content.
