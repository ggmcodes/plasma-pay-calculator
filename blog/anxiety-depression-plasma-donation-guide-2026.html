<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p><strong>Yes, you can donate plasma with anxiety or depression.</strong> These conditions do not disqualify you. Most commonly prescribed medications &mdash; including SSRIs (Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac), SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta), Wellbutrin, and buspirone &mdash; are accepted at all major plasma centers. As long as your condition is stable and managed, you are eligible to donate and earn money.</p></div>

<p>If you live with anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition, you have probably wondered whether plasma donation is an option for you. Maybe you read a confusing forum post, or the health screening questionnaire made you nervous about answering honestly. This guide breaks down everything you need to know &mdash; which conditions are accepted, which medications are fine, and practical tips for making the donation experience comfortable when you deal with mental health challenges.</p>

<p>The good news: the vast majority of people with mental health conditions can donate plasma safely and without any issues. Let us walk through the details so you can make an informed decision.</p>

<h2 id="conditions-accepted">Mental Health Conditions That Are Accepted</h2>

<p>Plasma centers evaluate your eligibility based on whether your condition is stable and whether you pose any health risk to yourself during the donation process. The following conditions are widely accepted at CSL Plasma, BioLife, Octapharma, Grifols, and other major centers.</p>

<h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</h3>
<p>Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental health conditions in the United States, affecting roughly 6.8 million adults. It does not disqualify you from plasma donation. Whether your anxiety is managed through medication, therapy, lifestyle changes, or a combination of all three, you are eligible to donate. The key factor is that your anxiety is not so severe on the day of donation that it prevents you from sitting still and completing the process safely.</p>

<h3>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h3>
<p>Depression, including major depressive disorder, does not disqualify you from donating plasma. Millions of regular plasma donors manage depression alongside their donation routine. In fact, many donors report that having a consistent schedule (plasma centers require visits every few days) provides helpful structure, and the extra income can reduce a major source of stress.</p>

<h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<p>Social anxiety can make the plasma center environment feel uncomfortable &mdash; the waiting room, the check-in process, and the screening interview can all be triggers. However, social anxiety does not disqualify you. Later in this guide, we cover specific techniques to manage social anxiety during your visit.</p>

<h3>Panic Disorder</h3>
<p>Having a history of panic attacks does not automatically disqualify you. If your panic disorder is managed and you can safely undergo the donation process, you are eligible. Staff at plasma centers are trained to handle situations where donors feel unwell, including panic symptoms.</p>

<h3>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</h3>
<p>ADHD is not a disqualifying condition. Whether you manage your ADHD with medication (Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Strattera) or without medication, you can donate plasma. The main challenge for donors with ADHD is sitting still for 45 to 90 minutes &mdash; bring your phone, a book, or download a podcast beforehand.</p>

<h3>OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)</h3>
<p>OCD does not disqualify you from donating plasma. If you take medication for OCD (typically SSRIs like Prozac or Luvox), those medications are accepted. If the clinical environment or needles trigger OCD-related thoughts, consider the coping strategies in the anxiety management section below.</p>

<h3>PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)</h3>
<p>PTSD by itself does not disqualify you from donating plasma. Many veterans and other individuals with PTSD donate regularly. If certain aspects of the donation process are triggering &mdash; needles, being in a clinical setting, feeling restrained &mdash; let the staff know. They can often accommodate you with a more private station or extra support during the process.</p>

<h3>Mild to Moderate Bipolar Disorder (Stable)</h3>
<p>If you have bipolar disorder that is well-managed with medication and you have not been hospitalized recently, many centers will accept you. The determining factor is stability. If you are in a stable period and your medication regimen has been consistent, you are generally eligible. However, this is one condition where policies vary between centers, so call ahead.</p>

<h2 id="conditions-may-disqualify">Conditions That May Disqualify You</h2>

<p>While most mental health conditions are accepted, a few situations may result in a temporary or permanent deferral. Understanding these upfront saves you a trip.</p>

<h3>Active Psychosis</h3>
<p>If you are currently experiencing psychotic symptoms &mdash; hallucinations, delusions, or severe disorganized thinking &mdash; you will be deferred. This is a safety concern. The donation process requires you to communicate clearly with staff, remain still, and report any problems during the procedure. Once psychotic symptoms are resolved and you are stable on medication, you may become eligible again.</p>

<h3>Bipolar Disorder with Recent Hospitalization</h3>
<p>If you have been hospitalized for a manic or depressive episode within the past several months, most centers will defer you. The specific waiting period varies by center &mdash; some require 6 months of stability, others may require a full year. This is not a permanent disqualification; it is a temporary deferral until you have demonstrated a stable period.</p>

<h3>Active Suicidal Ideation</h3>
<p>If you are currently experiencing suicidal thoughts, plasma centers will defer you out of concern for your safety and wellbeing. The screening questionnaire may ask about this directly. This is another temporary deferral &mdash; once you are stable, in treatment, and no longer experiencing active suicidal ideation, you can return to donating. <strong>If you are in crisis, please call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (dial 988) for immediate support.</strong></p>

<h3>Recent Psychiatric Medication Changes</h3>
<p>Some centers may defer you if you have changed your psychiatric medication within the past 30 days. The logic is that your body is still adjusting to the new medication, and adding plasma donation to the mix could complicate side effects or make it harder to evaluate how the new medication is working. This varies by center and is usually a short deferral of 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<h3>Severe Eating Disorders</h3>
<p>Active anorexia nervosa or bulimia may result in deferral. Plasma donation removes protein and fluids from your body, and if you are already nutritionally compromised, donation could pose a health risk. If your eating disorder is in recovery and your weight and labs are within acceptable ranges, you may be eligible.</p>

<h2 id="medications-accepted">Medications That Are Accepted</h2>

<p>This is the section most people are looking for. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of mental health medications and their typical acceptance status at major plasma centers.</p>

<h3>SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Zoloft</td><td>Sertraline</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lexapro</td><td>Escitalopram</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prozac</td><td>Fluoxetine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paxil</td><td>Paroxetine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Celexa</td><td>Citalopram</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Luvox</td><td>Fluvoxamine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the United States and are universally accepted at all major plasma centers. They work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain and do not affect plasma quality or the donation process.</p>

<h3>SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Effexor</td><td>Venlafaxine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cymbalta</td><td>Duloxetine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pristiq</td><td>Desvenlafaxine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>SNRIs are accepted across the board. Like SSRIs, they affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain and do not interfere with plasma quality.</p>

<h3>Other Accepted Antidepressants and Anxiety Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Used For</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Wellbutrin</td><td>Bupropion</td><td>Depression, smoking cessation</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Buspar</td><td>Buspirone</td><td>Anxiety</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remeron</td><td>Mirtazapine</td><td>Depression, insomnia</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Trazodone</td><td>Trazodone</td><td>Depression, insomnia</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vistaril</td><td>Hydroxyzine</td><td>Anxiety</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>ADHD Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Adderall</td><td>Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ritalin / Concerta</td><td>Methylphenidate</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vyvanse</td><td>Lisdexamfetamine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strattera</td><td>Atomoxetine</td><td>Accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Stimulant medications for ADHD are accepted. Take your medication as normally prescribed. There is no need to skip a dose before donating.</p>

<h3>Benzodiazepines (Prescribed)</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Xanax</td><td>Alprazolam</td><td>Usually Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Klonopin</td><td>Clonazepam</td><td>Usually Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ativan</td><td>Lorazepam</td><td>Usually Accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Valium</td><td>Diazepam</td><td>Usually Accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Benzodiazepines prescribed by a doctor are generally accepted. However, because these medications can cause drowsiness and impaired judgment, some centers may ask additional screening questions. Make sure you are not overly sedated on donation day. If the medication makes you drowsy, consider donating earlier in the day when you are most alert.</p>

<h2 id="medications-disqualify">Medications That May Disqualify You</h2>

<p>While most psychiatric medications are accepted, a small number may result in deferral.</p>

<h3>Lithium</h3>
<p>Lithium is the most notable disqualifying psychiatric medication. It is commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder and has a very narrow therapeutic range &mdash; meaning even small changes in blood concentration can lead to toxicity or reduced effectiveness. Because plasma donation removes a significant volume of fluid from your body, it could alter lithium levels in your blood. For your safety, most centers will defer you if you take lithium.</p>

<h3>Certain Antipsychotics (Case by Case)</h3>
<p>Most antipsychotic medications are accepted, but some centers evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Medications like Clozaril (clozapine), which requires regular blood monitoring due to its risk of agranulocytosis (dangerously low white blood cell counts), may result in deferral. Other antipsychotics like Abilify (aripiprazole), Seroquel (quetiapine), and Risperdal (risperidone) are generally accepted. The key question is usually about the condition being treated rather than the medication itself.</p>

<h3>MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)</h3>
<p>MAOIs like Nardil (phenelzine) and Parnate (tranylcypromine) are rarely prescribed today, but if you take one, policies vary by center. MAOIs have significant dietary restrictions and drug interactions, and some centers prefer to err on the side of caution. Call your local center to confirm before your visit.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Important Note About Medications</h3>
<p>Policies can vary between plasma companies and even between individual locations. <strong>Always be honest about your medications during the screening.</strong> If you are unsure whether your specific medication is accepted, call the center ahead of time. This saves you a wasted trip and ensures your safety.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="managing-anxiety">Managing Anxiety at the Plasma Center</h2>

<p>Even if you are medically cleared to donate, the actual experience of sitting in a plasma center with a needle in your arm can be anxiety-inducing. Here are proven techniques that donors with anxiety use to get through their appointments comfortably.</p>

<h3>Needle Phobia Tips</h3>
<p>Fear of needles (trypanophobia) affects an estimated 25% of adults to some degree. If needles are your main concern, try these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look away during the stick:</strong> You do not need to watch. Turn your head, close your eyes, or look at your phone. The stick takes about 5 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Tell the phlebotomist:</strong> Say "I am nervous about needles" before they start. Experienced staff deal with this daily and will talk you through it, warn you before the stick, and work quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Apply numbing cream:</strong> Over-the-counter lidocaine cream (like LMX or generic lidocaine 4%) applied 30 to 60 minutes before your appointment can reduce the sensation. Ask staff if this is allowed at your center.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the reward:</strong> Remind yourself that the needle insertion lasts seconds, but the payment lasts all week.</li>
<li><strong>Use the "cough trick":</strong> Some people find that coughing at the exact moment of the needle stick reduces the pain sensation. Ask the phlebotomist to count down so you can time it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breathing Exercises</h3>
<p>Controlled breathing is one of the fastest ways to reduce anxiety in the moment. Try these during your donation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4-7-8 Breathing:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat 3 to 4 times. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and physically calms your body.</li>
<li><strong>Box Breathing:</strong> Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. This technique is used by Navy SEALs and first responders to manage stress in high-pressure situations.</li>
<li><strong>Diaphragmatic Breathing:</strong> Place your free hand on your belly. Breathe in deeply so your belly rises (not your chest). Exhale slowly. Focusing on the physical sensation of your hand moving gives your brain something to do besides worry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Distraction Techniques</h3>
<p>Your best friend during plasma donation is distraction. Here is what experienced donors recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Podcasts or audiobooks:</strong> Long-form audio content is ideal for the 45 to 90 minute donation window. Download episodes before you arrive in case the center's WiFi is slow.</li>
<li><strong>Netflix, YouTube, or streaming:</strong> Download shows or videos before your appointment. Many donors binge-watch series exclusively during their plasma sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Music playlists:</strong> Create a calming or upbeat playlist specifically for donation day. Having a dedicated "plasma playlist" can create a positive association over time.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile games:</strong> One-handed phone games work perfectly since your other arm is occupied. Puzzle games, word games, and casual games are ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Texting or social media:</strong> Catching up on messages or scrolling through social media is how many donors pass the time.</li>
<li><strong>Guided meditation apps:</strong> Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer can help you relax during donation. Some donors use this time for their daily meditation practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grounding Techniques for Panic</h3>
<p>If you feel a panic attack coming on during donation, use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify <strong>5 things</strong> you can see</li>
<li>Identify <strong>4 things</strong> you can touch (the chair, your phone, the blanket, your clothing)</li>
<li>Identify <strong>3 things</strong> you can hear</li>
<li>Identify <strong>2 things</strong> you can smell</li>
<li>Identify <strong>1 thing</strong> you can taste</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique forces your brain to focus on your immediate environment rather than spiraling into anxious thoughts. It is remarkably effective and can stop a panic attack in its tracks.</p>

<h2 id="donation-mood">How Plasma Donation Can Affect Your Mood</h2>

<p>Understanding how donation might temporarily affect how you feel helps you plan ahead and avoid surprises.</p>

<h3>Temporary Fatigue</h3>
<p>The most common post-donation effect is fatigue. Your body has just had a portion of its plasma removed, and even though it regenerates within 24 to 48 hours, you may feel tired for several hours after donating. For someone already dealing with depression-related fatigue, this can feel amplified. Plan your donation so you do not have demanding obligations immediately afterward.</p>

<h3>Lightheadedness and Dizziness</h3>
<p>Some donors experience brief lightheadedness after donation, especially if they did not hydrate well beforehand. If you have anxiety, this physical sensation can sometimes trigger anxious thoughts ("something is wrong with me"). Knowing in advance that mild lightheadedness is normal and temporary can prevent it from escalating into anxiety.</p>

<h3>Mood Dip</h3>
<p>A small number of donors report a temporary mood dip in the hours after donating. This is likely related to the physical fatigue and fluid shift rather than any direct neurological effect. If you notice this pattern, schedule your donations on days when you have time to rest afterward and do not have stressful commitments.</p>

<h3>Positive Effects</h3>
<p>On the other hand, many donors with mental health conditions report positive effects from their donation routine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sense of purpose:</strong> Knowing your plasma is used to create life-saving medications can provide a meaningful sense of contribution.</li>
<li><strong>Routine and structure:</strong> Regular donation appointments add structure to your week, which is beneficial for managing depression.</li>
<li><strong>Social interaction:</strong> For donors who experience isolation, the brief interactions at the plasma center provide consistent social contact.</li>
<li><strong>Financial relief:</strong> Reduced money stress has a direct positive impact on mental health (more on this below).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="self-care">Self-Care Tips for Donors With Mental Health Conditions</h2>

<p>Donating plasma when you have anxiety or depression requires a little extra planning. These self-care strategies help you donate safely and feel your best.</p>

<h3>Before Donation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydrate heavily:</strong> Drink at least 16 ounces of water in the 2 hours before your appointment. Proper hydration makes the donation faster and reduces side effects. Dehydration can worsen anxiety symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Eat a solid meal:</strong> Have a meal with protein and complex carbohydrates 2 to 3 hours before donating. Low blood sugar can mimic or worsen anxiety symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Take your medication on schedule:</strong> Do not skip or change the timing of your psychiatric medication because of your donation. Take it as prescribed.</li>
<li><strong>Get adequate sleep:</strong> Being sleep-deprived worsens both anxiety and depression. Try to get a full night of sleep before donation day.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare your distractions:</strong> Download content, charge your phone, and bring earbuds before you leave the house. Having your comfort items ready reduces pre-appointment anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Donation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicate with staff:</strong> If you feel anxious, dizzy, or unwell at any point, tell the staff immediately. They would rather check on you than have you suffer in silence.</li>
<li><strong>Squeeze the stress ball:</strong> Most centers provide a squeeze ball for the hand on your donation arm. Use it rhythmically &mdash; it helps blood flow and gives you something to focus on.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your body warm:</strong> Some donors feel cold during donation because the returned fluids are cooler than body temperature. Bring a hoodie or blanket. Being cold can increase physical tension and worsen anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Practice your breathing:</strong> If anxiety spikes, shift to one of the breathing techniques described above. Even 60 seconds of controlled breathing can significantly reduce your anxiety level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Donation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat and drink immediately:</strong> Have a snack and water right after donating. Most centers provide snacks &mdash; take advantage of them.</li>
<li><strong>Rest before driving:</strong> Sit in your car or the center's waiting area for 10 to 15 minutes before driving, especially if you feel lightheaded.</li>
<li><strong>Take it easy:</strong> Avoid intense exercise, heavy lifting, or stressful activities for the rest of the day. Give your body time to recover.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor your mood:</strong> Pay attention to how you feel in the hours after donation. If you notice a consistent pattern of mood dips, adjust your donation schedule to account for it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-to-pause">When to Take a Break From Donating</h2>

<p>Donating plasma is a commitment, and your mental health should always come first. Consider pausing your donations if:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Your medication recently changed:</strong> Give yourself 2 to 4 weeks on any new psychiatric medication before resuming donations. This lets you and your doctor evaluate the new medication without the additional variable of plasma donation.</li>
<li><strong>You are in a depressive episode:</strong> If you are going through a particularly rough stretch, the fatigue from donation may make things harder. It is okay to take a break and come back when you are more stable.</li>
<li><strong>Anxiety about donating is overwhelming:</strong> If the anxiety of going to the center is outweighing the benefit of the payment, take a break. You can always return when you feel ready.</li>
<li><strong>You are physically unwell:</strong> If your appetite is poor, you are not sleeping, or you are dehydrated due to your mental health, your body may not be in the best state for donation.</li>
<li><strong>Your therapist or psychiatrist advises it:</strong> If your mental health provider recommends pausing donations, listen to them. They understand your complete clinical picture.</li>
<li><strong>Donation is causing distress:</strong> If you dread every visit, feel worse after every donation, or are pushing through despite significant discomfort, take time off. Plasma donation should not feel like suffering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>You can always return to donating once you feel better. There is no penalty for taking a break, and your eligibility does not expire. Your mental health is more valuable than any payment.</p>

<h2 id="financial-benefit">The Financial Benefit: How Plasma Income Helps Mental Health</h2>

<p>It is well-documented that financial stress is one of the leading contributors to anxiety and depression. A 2023 American Psychological Association survey found that money is consistently the top source of stress for American adults. Plasma donation can directly address this.</p>

<h3>What You Can Earn</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New donors:</strong> $600 to $1,000+ in the first month with new donor bonuses</li>
<li><strong>Regular donors:</strong> $300 to $600+ per month with twice-weekly donations</li>
<li><strong>Annual earnings:</strong> $3,600 to $7,000+ per year depending on center, location, and promotions</li>
</ul>
<p>Use our <a href="/">Plasma Pay Calculator</a> to estimate your specific earnings based on your weight, location, and center.</p>

<h3>How Extra Income Reduces Anxiety</h3>
<p>That extra $300 to $600 per month can make a meaningful difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cover therapy copays:</strong> Many insurance plans have $20 to $50 copays per therapy session. Plasma income can cover weekly therapy costs.</li>
<li><strong>Pay for medication:</strong> Psychiatric medication copays, especially for brand-name drugs, can add up. Plasma income helps offset these costs.</li>
<li><strong>Build an emergency fund:</strong> Having even a small financial cushion reduces the anxiety that comes from living paycheck to paycheck.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce debt stress:</strong> Putting plasma income toward credit card debt or medical bills reduces a major source of ongoing anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Create breathing room:</strong> Knowing you have extra income gives you mental space. You worry less about unexpected expenses when you have a buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The relationship between financial stress and mental health works in both directions. Reducing financial pressure through plasma income can create a positive cycle where less money stress leads to better mental health, which leads to more consistent donations, which leads to more stable income.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have anxiety?</h3>
<p>Yes. Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and panic disorder do not disqualify you from donating plasma. You can donate as long as your condition is managed and you feel well on donation day. Most anxiety medications including SSRIs, SNRIs, and buspirone are accepted at all major plasma centers.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you take antidepressants?</h3>
<p>Yes, most antidepressants are accepted for plasma donation. SSRIs (Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac), SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and buspirone (Buspar) are all generally accepted. Lithium is typically the only major exception that will result in deferral.</p>

<h3>Does donating plasma make anxiety or depression worse?</h3>
<p>Most donors with managed anxiety or depression do not report worsening symptoms. Some may experience temporary fatigue or lightheadedness after donation, which can briefly affect mood. Staying hydrated, eating well, and resting after donation helps minimize any effects. If you notice a consistent pattern of mood dips after donating, consider adjusting your schedule or speaking with your doctor.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you take Adderall or Ritalin?</h3>
<p>Yes, stimulant medications prescribed for ADHD such as Adderall (amphetamine), Ritalin (methylphenidate), and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) are generally accepted at plasma centers. You should take your medication as normally prescribed on donation day. There is no need to skip a dose.</p>

<h3>Does lithium disqualify you from plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Yes, lithium is typically a disqualifying medication for plasma donation. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range and plasma removal could affect blood lithium levels, potentially leading to toxicity or reduced effectiveness. If you take lithium for bipolar disorder or any other condition, you will likely be deferred.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with PTSD?</h3>
<p>Yes, PTSD alone does not disqualify you from donating plasma. As long as your condition is stable and managed, you can donate. Common PTSD medications like SSRIs and SNRIs are accepted. If the donation environment triggers anxiety or flashbacks, inform the staff so they can accommodate you with a more private station or additional support.</p>

<h3>What if I have a panic attack while donating plasma?</h3>
<p>If you have a panic attack during donation, alert the staff immediately. They are trained to handle this situation and will stay calm and help you through it. They may pause or stop the donation if needed. Techniques like deep breathing (try the 4-7-8 method), the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise, and distraction through your phone or music can help manage anxiety during donation. If panic attacks happen repeatedly during donation, talk to your doctor about strategies before your next visit.</p>

<h3>Should I tell the plasma center about my mental health condition?</h3>
<p>Yes, always be honest during your health screening. Withholding medical information can affect your safety during the donation process. Most mental health conditions will not disqualify you, so there is no reason to hide them. The screening is confidential, and staff are trained to handle this information professionally. Being upfront also means staff can better support you if any issues arise during donation.</p>
