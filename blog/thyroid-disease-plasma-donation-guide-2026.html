<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>Most thyroid conditions are accepted for plasma donation as long as they are stable and well-controlled. <strong>Hypothyroidism on levothyroxine (Synthroid)?</strong> Accepted at nearly all centers. <strong>Graves' disease?</strong> Depends on whether it is controlled. <strong>Thyroid cancer history?</strong> Usually disqualifying or requires a long remission period. The key factors are stable medication, normal screening vitals, and no active autoimmune flare.</p></div>

<p>Thyroid disease is one of the most common endocrine disorders in the United States, affecting an estimated 20 million Americans. If you are among them, you have probably wondered whether your thyroid condition disqualifies you from donating plasma and earning extra income. The good news is that the vast majority of people with thyroid disease can donate plasma. But the specifics matter, and the answer depends on your exact diagnosis, your current treatment, how stable your condition is, and which plasma center you visit.</p>

<p>This guide covers every thyroid-related scenario you might face as a plasma donor in 2026, from common hypothyroidism managed with a daily pill to more complex situations like Graves' disease, thyroid cancer history, and post-thyroidectomy donation. We will walk through which medications are accepted, how thyroid disease affects your screening vitals, what TSH levels centers look for, and practical tips to make your donation experience smooth.</p>

<h2 id="hypothyroidism">Hypothyroidism and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid, is the most common thyroid disorder and the one most likely to affect plasma donors. The thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, cold sensitivity, and brain fog when untreated. The most frequent cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.</p>

<h3>Hashimoto's Thyroiditis</h3>
<p>Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease, which sometimes raises red flags for donors. However, plasma centers distinguish between autoimmune conditions that affect the safety of your plasma and those that do not. Hashimoto's falls into the "generally accepted" category because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The autoimmune antibodies target your own thyroid tissue, not something that would harm a plasma recipient</li>
<li>The condition is managed with straightforward hormone replacement</li>
<li>It does not require immunosuppressant drugs in most cases</li>
<li>Your plasma protein levels are typically unaffected</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as your Hashimoto's is treated and your symptoms are well-controlled, you should be eligible to donate at most plasma centers. Centers care about whether you feel well, whether your vitals are in range, and whether your medication is stable, not about the presence of thyroid antibodies in your blood.</p>

<h3>Hypothyroidism Managed With Levothyroxine</h3>
<p>This is the most straightforward scenario. If you take levothyroxine (brand names include Synthroid, Levoxyl, Tirosint, Euthyrox, or Unithroid) and your dose has been stable, you are eligible to donate plasma at virtually every major center. Levothyroxine is simply a synthetic version of the T4 hormone your thyroid would normally produce. It is not an immunosuppressant, not a blood thinner, and not a medication that affects plasma quality.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Hypothyroidism Eligibility Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled on levothyroxine:</strong> Accepted at nearly all centers</li>
<li><strong>Hashimoto's thyroiditis:</strong> Accepted if stable and treated</li>
<li><strong>Recently diagnosed:</strong> May need to wait until dose is stabilized (typically 6-8 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Uncontrolled/symptomatic:</strong> Temporary deferral until stable</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>What "Stable" Means for Hypothyroidism</h3>
<p>Plasma centers want to see that your thyroid condition is not in active flux. In practical terms, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been on the same medication dose for at least 4-6 weeks (some centers say 3 months)</li>
<li>You are not experiencing severe hypothyroid symptoms like extreme fatigue or significant edema</li>
<li>Your heart rate and blood pressure fall within the normal screening range</li>
<li>You have not had a recent dose change that might affect your vitals</li>
</ul>

<p>If your doctor just adjusted your levothyroxine dose last week, it is a good idea to wait until your body adjusts and your next blood work confirms you are on the right track before attempting to donate.</p>

<h2 id="hyperthyroidism">Hyperthyroidism and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid, is more complex when it comes to plasma donation eligibility. The thyroid produces too much hormone, leading to symptoms like rapid heart rate, weight loss, anxiety, tremors, and heat intolerance. The most common cause is Graves' disease, another autoimmune condition.</p>

<h3>Graves' Disease</h3>
<p>Graves' disease is where eligibility gets nuanced. Unlike Hashimoto's, Graves' disease produces antibodies (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins) that actively stimulate the thyroid to overproduce hormones. The eligibility picture depends heavily on your current treatment status:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Graves' Disease Status</th><th>Eligibility</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Active, untreated</td><td>Not eligible</td><td>Elevated heart rate and BP will fail screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>On methimazole, stabilizing</td><td>Maybe</td><td>Depends on vitals and center policy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Controlled on methimazole</td><td>Likely eligible</td><td>Must pass vitals screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>In remission (off meds)</td><td>Eligible</td><td>Standard screening applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post-RAI treatment</td><td>Waiting period</td><td>See radioactive iodine section below</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post-thyroidectomy</td><td>Likely eligible</td><td>Once healed and stable on replacement hormone</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The biggest practical challenge for people with hyperthyroidism, even when treated, is passing the vitals screening. An overactive thyroid pushes your heart rate and blood pressure up. If your resting heart rate is over 100 bpm (the typical screening cutoff), you will be deferred regardless of what is causing it. We cover strategies to manage this in the screening section below.</p>

<h3>Other Causes of Hyperthyroidism</h3>
<p>Graves' disease is not the only cause of an overactive thyroid. Toxic nodular goiter, thyroiditis (inflammation), and excessive iodine intake can all cause hyperthyroidism. The eligibility principles are the same: if the condition is resolved or controlled and your vitals are within range, you can likely donate. If you are in an active hyperthyroid state with symptoms, you will be deferred.</p>

<h2 id="medications">Thyroid Medications: Which Ones Are Accepted?</h2>

<p>One of the first questions the plasma center staff or screening questionnaire will ask is what medications you take. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of thyroid medications and their impact on plasma donation eligibility.</p>

<h3>Accepted Thyroid Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Medication</th><th>Used For</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl)</td><td>Hypothyroidism</td><td>Accepted everywhere</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liothyronine (Cytomel)</td><td>Hypothyroidism (T3)</td><td>Accepted at most centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Armour Thyroid / NP Thyroid</td><td>Hypothyroidism (natural desiccated)</td><td>Accepted at most centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tirosint</td><td>Hypothyroidism (liquid/gel cap)</td><td>Accepted everywhere</td></tr>
<tr><td>Methimazole (Tapazole)</td><td>Hyperthyroidism</td><td>Accepted if dose is stable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Propylthiouracil (PTU)</td><td>Hyperthyroidism</td><td>Varies by center, often accepted</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Medications That May Cause Issues</h3>
<p>While thyroid medications themselves are rarely the problem, related medications might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol):</strong> Sometimes prescribed alongside hyperthyroid treatment to control heart rate. These are generally accepted for plasma donation but may be flagged for review at some centers.</li>
<li><strong>Immunosuppressants:</strong> If your thyroid condition is part of a broader autoimmune profile and you take immunosuppressive drugs, those medications (not the thyroid ones) may disqualify you.</li>
<li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> Occasionally used in thyroiditis. Short-term or low-dose prednisone is usually acceptable; long-term high-dose steroids may trigger deferral.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Pro Tip: Medication Disclosure</h3>
<p>Always disclose every medication you take, including over-the-counter supplements. Trying to hide a medication to avoid deferral is a bad idea. The screening is designed to protect both you and the plasma recipients. If you are unsure about a specific medication, call the center before your visit to confirm eligibility.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="thyroid-cancer">Thyroid Cancer History and Eligibility</h2>

<p>This is the most restrictive thyroid-related scenario for plasma donation. A history of thyroid cancer significantly impacts eligibility, and the rules are stricter than for other thyroid conditions.</p>

<h3>General Cancer Deferral Policies</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers follow FDA guidance and their own corporate medical policies regarding cancer history. The standard approach is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active cancer of any type:</strong> Permanently deferred at all centers</li>
<li><strong>Cancer in remission:</strong> Varies by center, but most require a minimum cancer-free period</li>
<li><strong>Thyroid cancer specifically:</strong> Usually requires 1-5 years cancer-free, depending on the center and the type/stage of cancer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thyroid Cancer Types and Eligibility</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Cancer Type</th><th>Typical Eligibility</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Papillary (most common)</td><td>May qualify after remission period</td><td>Low-risk, good prognosis helps</td></tr>
<tr><td>Follicular</td><td>May qualify after remission period</td><td>Similar to papillary in eligibility</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medullary</td><td>Often permanently deferred</td><td>Higher recurrence risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anaplastic</td><td>Permanently deferred</td><td>Aggressive cancer type</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If you had papillary or follicular thyroid cancer, were treated successfully, and have been cancer-free for the required period (commonly 3-5 years), some centers will accept you. However, you will almost certainly need to provide documentation from your oncologist or endocrinologist. Bring a letter stating your diagnosis, treatment dates, and current cancer-free status to your first appointment.</p>

<h2 id="thyroidectomy">Thyroidectomy and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>A thyroidectomy (surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland) is a common treatment for several thyroid conditions, including large goiters, Graves' disease that does not respond to medication, thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. Your eligibility after thyroidectomy depends primarily on why you had the surgery.</p>

<h3>Thyroidectomy for Benign Conditions</h3>
<p>If your thyroidectomy was for a non-cancerous reason, such as a goiter causing compression symptoms, Graves' disease, or benign nodules, your path back to plasma donation is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Full surgical recovery:</strong> Wait until your surgical wound is completely healed (typically 4-8 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Stable on replacement hormone:</strong> Your levothyroxine dose needs to be established and stable (usually 6-12 weeks post-surgery for dose optimization)</li>
<li><strong>Vitals within range:</strong> Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature all need to be in the acceptable screening range</li>
<li><strong>Feeling well:</strong> No significant surgical complications or ongoing symptoms</li>
</ol>

<p>In total, most people can return to plasma donation roughly 3-4 months after a thyroidectomy for benign conditions, once they are stable on their replacement thyroid hormone.</p>

<h3>Thyroidectomy for Cancer</h3>
<p>If your thyroidectomy was performed as part of cancer treatment, the cancer deferral policies described above apply. The surgery itself is not the issue; the cancer history is. You will need to meet the cancer-free waiting period and likely provide medical documentation before you can donate.</p>

<h2 id="radioactive-iodine">Radioactive Iodine Treatment Wait Times</h2>

<p>Radioactive iodine (RAI or I-131) therapy is used to treat both hyperthyroidism (particularly Graves' disease) and thyroid cancer. It involves ingesting a radioactive form of iodine that is absorbed by thyroid tissue, effectively destroying overactive or cancerous thyroid cells. Because this treatment involves radioactivity, there are specific wait times before you can donate plasma.</p>

<h3>RAI Wait Periods by Scenario</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>RAI Reason</th><th>Typical Wait Period</th><th>Additional Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Graves' disease treatment</td><td>6-12 months</td><td>Must be stable on thyroid replacement hormone</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thyroid cancer ablation (low dose)</td><td>12 months minimum</td><td>Plus cancer-free documentation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thyroid cancer ablation (high dose)</td><td>12-24 months</td><td>Plus cancer-free documentation</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The wait period serves two purposes. First, it ensures that any residual radioactivity in your body has decayed to undetectable levels (the biological half-life of I-131 is about 8 days, so radioactivity itself clears within weeks, but centers build in a safety margin). Second, it gives time for your thyroid replacement therapy to stabilize, since RAI destroys thyroid tissue and most patients become hypothyroid and need levothyroxine afterward.</p>

<h3>What to Bring After RAI Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation showing the date of your RAI treatment</li>
<li>A letter from your endocrinologist confirming you are stable and cleared for donation</li>
<li>Recent lab work showing thyroid function levels (TSH, free T4)</li>
<li>For cancer patients: documentation of cancer-free status</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screening">How Thyroid Disease Affects Screening Vitals</h2>

<p>Every plasma donation begins with a screening where staff check your vital signs. This is where thyroid disease can cause problems even if your condition is technically "accepted." Your thyroid hormones directly influence heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, all of which are measured at screening.</p>

<h3>Screening Cutoffs at Most Centers</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Vital</th><th>Acceptable Range</th><th>Thyroid Impact</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Heart rate</td><td>50-100 bpm</td><td>Hyperthyroid = elevated; Hypothyroid = may be low</td></tr>
<tr><td>Systolic BP</td><td>90-180 mmHg</td><td>Hyperthyroid can raise it</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diastolic BP</td><td>50-100 mmHg</td><td>Hyperthyroid can raise it</td></tr>
<tr><td>Temperature</td><td>Below 99.5F</td><td>Thyroiditis or thyroid storm can elevate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hematocrit/protein</td><td>Varies by center</td><td>Usually unaffected by thyroid disease</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Hyperthyroidism and Elevated Heart Rate</h3>
<p>The most common screening failure for thyroid patients is elevated heart rate. Even mildly overactive thyroid function can push your resting heart rate above 100 bpm. If you are being treated for hyperthyroidism and your heart rate runs high, try these strategies before your appointment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit quietly for 10-15 minutes before check-in to let your heart rate settle</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine for at least 4-6 hours before your appointment</li>
<li>Practice slow, deep breathing during the vitals check</li>
<li>Stay well-hydrated, as dehydration elevates heart rate</li>
<li>If your heart rate is consistently over 100 bpm, talk to your doctor about whether your thyroid medication dose needs adjustment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hypothyroidism and Low Heart Rate</h3>
<p>On the flip side, severe hypothyroidism can cause bradycardia (heart rate below 50 bpm), which is also outside the acceptable screening range. This is less common in well-treated hypothyroidism but worth knowing about. If your heart rate is chronically below 50 bpm, this may indicate your levothyroxine dose needs to be increased.</p>

<h2 id="tsh-levels">TSH Levels and Donation Eligibility</h2>

<p>TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is the primary lab marker used to assess thyroid function. Plasma centers do not typically test your TSH during screening. They do not draw blood to check your thyroid levels. Instead, they rely on your vitals, your medication disclosure, and your self-reported health status.</p>

<h3>Why TSH Still Matters</h3>
<p>Even though centers do not test your TSH directly, your TSH level indirectly affects your ability to pass screening:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High TSH (underactive thyroid):</strong> If your TSH is very elevated, you may be symptomatic with fatigue, low heart rate, or low blood pressure. You might not feel well enough to donate.</li>
<li><strong>Low TSH (overactive thyroid):</strong> If your TSH is suppressed, you may have elevated heart rate, anxiety, or tremors that could affect screening or your comfort during the procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Normal TSH (0.4-4.0 mIU/L):</strong> Indicates your medication dose is correct and you are likely to pass screening without thyroid-related issues.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Best Practice for TSH</h3>
<p>Get regular lab work from your doctor (every 6-12 months for most thyroid patients) and keep your TSH in the normal or near-normal range. This not only helps with plasma donation but also means your thyroid condition is well-managed overall. If your last TSH was significantly out of range, work with your doctor to adjust your medication before starting a plasma donation routine.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="nodules">Thyroid Nodules and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Thyroid nodules are extremely common, found in up to 50% of people by age 60 when using ultrasound screening. The vast majority are benign and cause no problems. Here is how nodules affect plasma donation eligibility:</p>

<h3>Benign Nodules</h3>
<p>If your thyroid nodules have been evaluated (typically with ultrasound and possibly fine-needle aspiration biopsy) and found to be benign, they should not affect your plasma donation eligibility at all. You do not even need to bring documentation in most cases, though having your biopsy results available never hurts.</p>

<h3>Nodules Under Monitoring</h3>
<p>If you have nodules that your doctor is monitoring with periodic ultrasounds but has not recommended biopsy (often because they are small or have benign characteristics), you can generally still donate plasma. These "watch and wait" nodules are not considered an active disease process.</p>

<h3>Suspicious or Indeterminate Nodules</h3>
<p>If you have nodules that are awaiting biopsy, have indeterminate biopsy results, or are being evaluated for possible cancer, it is best to wait until you have a clear diagnosis before donating plasma. This is both for your own health and because the center may defer you if they learn you are in the middle of a cancer workup.</p>

<h2 id="pregnancy-thyroid">Pregnancy-Related Thyroid Issues</h2>

<p>Pregnancy can trigger or worsen thyroid conditions, including gestational hypothyroidism, postpartum thyroiditis, and exacerbation of pre-existing Hashimoto's or Graves' disease. Here is how these affect plasma donation:</p>

<h3>During Pregnancy</h3>
<p>You cannot donate plasma while pregnant, regardless of thyroid status. This is a universal rule at all plasma centers, so thyroid issues during pregnancy are irrelevant to donation eligibility.</p>

<h3>Postpartum Thyroiditis</h3>
<p>Postpartum thyroiditis affects 5-10% of women after delivery. It typically involves a hyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase, resolving within 12-18 months. For plasma donation eligibility after pregnancy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must wait the standard post-pregnancy period (usually 6 weeks to 6 months after delivery, depending on the center)</li>
<li>If you developed postpartum thyroiditis, wait until your thyroid levels stabilize, either by resolving on their own or through medication</li>
<li>If you are placed on levothyroxine for postpartum hypothyroidism, you can donate once your dose is stable and you are past the post-pregnancy waiting period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gestational Thyroid Issues That Resolved</h3>
<p>If you had thyroid issues only during pregnancy and they fully resolved after delivery (no ongoing medication), this should not affect your plasma donation eligibility at all once you are past the standard post-pregnancy waiting period.</p>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-by-Center Thyroid Policies</h2>

<p>Policies vary between plasma companies and even between individual locations within the same company. Here is what we know about the major plasma center chains as of 2026:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>Hypothyroidism (Levo)</th><th>Graves' Disease</th><th>Thyroid Cancer History</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CSL Plasma</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>BioLife</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>BPL Plasma</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grifols</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>KEDPLASMA</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octapharma</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Case-by-case</td><td>Deferral period applies</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few important notes on center policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Case-by-case" means exactly that:</strong> A center medical director or nurse will review your specific situation. Different people with Graves' disease may get different decisions based on their disease activity and treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Call ahead:</strong> If you have a thyroid condition more complex than simple hypothyroidism on levothyroxine, save yourself a trip by calling the center before your visit. Ask to speak with a medical staff member who can pre-screen your condition.</li>
<li><strong>Bring documentation:</strong> A letter from your endocrinologist or a recent lab printout showing your thyroid levels can speed up the review process and improve your chances of being accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Policies change:</strong> Centers update their medical guidelines periodically. What was deferred last year may be accepted this year, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>What to Do If One Center Defers You</h3>
<p>If you are deferred at one plasma center for your thyroid condition, try another center from a different company. Medical policies vary between organizations, and what disqualifies you at CSL might be accepted at BioLife or vice versa. However, do not lie about your medical history at the new center. Be honest about your condition and any previous deferrals.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips for Thyroid Donors: Maximize Success</h2>

<h3>Timing Your Medication</h3>
<p>For the best donation experience with thyroid disease, medication timing matters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take levothyroxine on your normal schedule.</strong> Do not skip your dose on donation day. Consistent medication use is what keeps your vitals stable.</li>
<li><strong>Morning levothyroxine takers:</strong> Take your pill on an empty stomach when you wake up, wait 30-60 minutes, then eat a protein-rich breakfast and hydrate before your appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Evening levothyroxine takers:</strong> No special adjustment needed for donation day. Just follow your normal routine.</li>
<li><strong>Methimazole users:</strong> Take as prescribed. Do not adjust your dose before donation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Energy and Fatigue</h3>
<p>Thyroid patients, especially those with hypothyroidism, often deal with fatigue. Plasma donation can temporarily increase that fatigue. Here are strategies to minimize the impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donate on a day when you feel your best.</strong> If your energy fluctuates, schedule donations for your higher-energy days.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrate aggressively.</strong> Drink at least 16-20 ounces of water in the 2-3 hours before donation. Dehydration worsens both thyroid fatigue and post-donation fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Eat iron-rich and protein-rich foods.</strong> Your body needs protein to replenish the plasma proteins you donate. Iron supports healthy hemoglobin levels for screening.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for recovery time.</strong> Give yourself a few hours of low-key activity after donation, especially if you are prone to thyroid-related fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Do not donate when you are feeling symptomatic.</strong> If your thyroid is acting up and you are exhausted, shaky, or unwell, skip that donation. Your health comes first, and you might fail screening anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing for Your First Visit</h3>
<p>Your first plasma donation with a thyroid condition will involve more review than subsequent visits. Be prepared with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A list of all medications</strong> including exact doses and how long you have been taking them</li>
<li><strong>Your diagnosis</strong> (Hashimoto's, Graves', thyroid nodules, etc.) and how long ago you were diagnosed</li>
<li><strong>Recent lab work</strong> if available (TSH, free T4, free T3)</li>
<li><strong>Doctor's note</strong> if your condition is complex (cancer history, recent surgery, recent RAI)</li>
<li><strong>Valid ID and proof of address</strong> as required for all new donors</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps Based on Your Plasma Donation Estimate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check your vitals at home:</strong> If you have a home blood pressure cuff, check your heart rate and blood pressure before heading to the center. If your heart rate is over 100 bpm or your BP is out of range, consider rescheduling.</li>
<li><strong>Call your center:</strong> For any thyroid condition beyond simple hypothyroidism, a quick phone call can save you a wasted trip.</li>
<li><strong>Get your labs current:</strong> If your last thyroid blood work is over 6 months old, schedule a check with your doctor. Current labs support your eligibility case.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with hypothyroidism?</h3>
<p>Yes, in most cases. If your hypothyroidism is well-controlled with medication like levothyroxine (Synthroid) and your TSH levels are within a normal or near-normal range, most plasma centers will accept you. You must be feeling well on the day of donation and pass standard screening vitals including heart rate (50-100 bpm), blood pressure, and temperature.</p>

<h3>Does levothyroxine disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>No. Levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Tirosint) is accepted at virtually all major plasma centers including CSL Plasma, BioLife, BPL Plasma, and Grifols. It is a synthetic thyroid hormone replacement, not an immunosuppressant, so it does not affect plasma safety. Just make sure to disclose it during your health screening questionnaire.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with Graves' disease?</h3>
<p>It depends on your treatment and disease activity. If Graves' disease is in remission or well-controlled with methimazole and your vitals are stable, some centers will accept you. Active or uncontrolled Graves' disease with elevated heart rate or blood pressure will result in deferral. Call your center ahead of time to discuss your specific situation.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma after thyroidectomy?</h3>
<p>If your thyroidectomy was for a benign condition (like goiter or Graves' disease), most centers will accept you once you are fully healed and stable on replacement thyroid hormone, typically 3-4 months post-surgery. If the thyroidectomy was for thyroid cancer, most centers require a cancer-free period (often 3-5 years) before eligibility.</p>

<h3>Does radioactive iodine treatment affect plasma donation eligibility?</h3>
<p>Yes. Most centers require a waiting period after radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, typically 6-12 months minimum for hyperthyroidism treatment and 12-24 months for thyroid cancer ablation. You must be stable on thyroid replacement medication and no longer radioactive before donating. Bring documentation of your treatment date.</p>

<h3>Will my thyroid medication affect my screening vitals?</h3>
<p>It can. If your thyroid medication dose is too high, you may present with elevated heart rate (over 100 bpm) or high blood pressure at screening, which could cause a temporary deferral. If your dose is too low, you might have a low heart rate (under 50 bpm). Taking your medication at a consistent time and ensuring your dose is correct through regular lab work helps keep screening vitals within the acceptable range.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma with thyroid nodules?</h3>
<p>Generally yes, as long as the nodules have been evaluated by your doctor and are benign. If nodules are being monitored without treatment, most plasma centers will not defer you. Nodules that have been biopsied and confirmed non-cancerous are typically fine. If you are in the middle of a cancer workup for suspicious nodules, wait until you have a clear diagnosis.</p>

<h3>Should I take my thyroid medication before donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Yes, take your thyroid medication on your normal schedule. Do not skip doses to try to affect screening results. Consistent medication use actually helps you pass vitals screening by keeping your heart rate and blood pressure stable. Take levothyroxine on an empty stomach in the morning as directed, then eat a protein-rich meal and hydrate well before your appointment.</p>
