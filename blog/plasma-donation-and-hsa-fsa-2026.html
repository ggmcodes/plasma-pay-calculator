<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer">
    <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
    <p><strong>No, you generally cannot use HSA (Health Savings Account) or FSA (Flexible Spending Account) funds for plasma donation-related expenses.</strong> HSA and FSA accounts are restricted to qualified medical expenses as defined by the IRS, and plasma donation is not a medical treatment or procedure &mdash; it is a compensated activity. However, there are narrow exceptions: supplements or medications prescribed by a doctor for a medical condition (not just to help with donations) MAY qualify. Mileage to and from the plasma center is a separate tax deduction, not an HSA/FSA expense.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="hsa-fsa-basics">HSA & FSA Basics: What They Cover</h2>

<p>Before diving into plasma-specific rules, it helps to understand what HSA and FSA accounts are designed for:</p>

<h3>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Individuals enrolled in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)</li>
    <li><strong>2026 contribution limits:</strong> $4,300 individual / $8,550 family (estimated, adjusted for inflation)</li>
    <li><strong>Tax advantage:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free</li>
    <li><strong>Rollover:</strong> Funds roll over year to year &mdash; no "use it or lose it"</li>
    <li><strong>Qualified expenses:</strong> Doctor visits, prescriptions, dental, vision, medical devices, and other IRS-approved medical costs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Employees whose employer offers an FSA plan</li>
    <li><strong>2026 contribution limit:</strong> ~$3,200 (estimated)</li>
    <li><strong>Tax advantage:</strong> Contributions reduce taxable income; withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free</li>
    <li><strong>Rollover:</strong> Limited &mdash; most plans have a "use it or lose it" rule with a small grace period or $640 carryover</li>
    <li><strong>Qualified expenses:</strong> Same as HSA &mdash; IRS-defined medical expenses</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Key Rule</h3>
<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">IRS Definition of Qualified Medical Expense</p>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Per IRS Publication 502, qualified medical expenses are costs for the "diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body." The expense must be primarily for medical care.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="why-plasma-doesnt-qualify">Why Plasma Donation Expenses Don't Qualify</h2>

<p>Plasma donation is not a medical procedure performed on you for your health benefit. It is a compensated activity where you provide a biological product to a commercial company. Here is why common plasma-related expenses fail the HSA/FSA test:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Expense</th>
            <th>HSA/FSA Eligible?</th>
            <th>Why Not</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Hydration drinks (Liquid I.V., Pedialyte)</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>General wellness / nutrition product, not medical treatment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protein shakes or supplements</td>
            <td>No (usually)</td>
            <td>Dietary supplements are not qualified unless prescribed for a specific medical condition</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Iron supplements</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
            <td>If prescribed by a doctor for diagnosed iron deficiency, YES. If purchased over-the-counter for donation prep, NO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vitamins (multivitamin, B12, etc.)</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>General health supplements are not qualified medical expenses</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Transportation to the center</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Travel to a plasma center is not travel for medical care</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Compression arm sleeves</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Used for donation recovery, not a prescribed medical device</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bandages or wound care</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
            <td>Basic first aid supplies may qualify under general HSA/FSA rules, but not specifically because of plasma donation</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>The fundamental issue:</strong> You are donating plasma to earn money, not to receive medical treatment. The IRS draws a clear line between medical care (eligible) and income-generating activities (not eligible) when it comes to HSA/FSA spending.</p>

<h2 id="possible-exceptions">Possible Exceptions: When HSA/FSA Might Apply</h2>

<p>There are narrow circumstances where an expense related to your plasma donation lifestyle COULD qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement &mdash; but only if the primary purpose is medical, not donation-related:</p>

<h3>Exception 1: Doctor-Prescribed Supplements for a Medical Condition</h3>
<p>If your doctor diagnoses you with a specific medical condition (such as iron deficiency anemia) and prescribes iron supplements as treatment, those supplements are HSA/FSA eligible &mdash; regardless of whether you also happen to donate plasma. The key distinction:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eligible:</strong> Doctor diagnoses iron deficiency, writes a prescription or Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) for iron supplements &rarr; HSA/FSA covers it</li>
    <li><strong>Not eligible:</strong> You buy iron supplements on your own to help with plasma donation screening &rarr; HSA/FSA does NOT cover it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exception 2: Medical Treatment for Donation-Related Complications</h3>
<p>If you experience a medical complication from plasma donation (such as a vein infection, nerve injury, or severe bruising requiring medical attention), the treatment costs ARE qualified medical expenses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doctor visits for donation-related complications &rarr; HSA/FSA eligible</li>
    <li>Prescribed antibiotics for infection at the needle site &rarr; HSA/FSA eligible</li>
    <li>Physical therapy for nerve damage &rarr; HSA/FSA eligible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exception 3: First Aid Supplies (General Category)</h3>
<p>Bandages, gauze, antiseptic wipes, and other basic first aid supplies are generally HSA/FSA eligible as medical supplies. If you use these after a plasma donation, the purchase qualifies &mdash; but not because it is plasma-related. These items qualify on their own as general medical supplies.</p>

<h2 id="mileage-deductions">Mileage Deductions Are Separate (Tax Deduction, Not HSA/FSA)</h2>

<p>A common point of confusion: mileage to and from the plasma center is a potential <strong>tax deduction</strong>, not an HSA/FSA expense. These are completely different financial mechanisms:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>HSA/FSA</th>
            <th>Tax Deduction (Mileage)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>What it is</td>
            <td>Tax-free spending account for medical expenses</td>
            <td>Reduction of taxable income</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Plasma mileage eligible?</td>
            <td>No &mdash; not medical travel</td>
            <td>Yes &mdash; travel to produce taxable income</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2026 rate</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>~$0.70-$0.72/mile (IRS business rate)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>How to claim</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>On your tax return (Schedule 1 offset or Schedule A)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Documentation needed</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>Mileage log with dates, destinations, round-trip miles</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>If your plasma center is 15 miles away and you donate twice weekly, that is roughly 2,880 miles per year &mdash; a potential deduction of ~$2,000+ at the IRS mileage rate. But this deduction comes off your tax return, not from your HSA or FSA account.</p>

<h2 id="what-donors-can-do">What Plasma Donors Can Actually Do to Save Money</h2>

<p>Even though HSA/FSA funds cannot be used for most plasma-related expenses, there are legitimate ways to reduce the cost of donating:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Track mileage for tax deductions:</strong> Keep a mileage log and deduct transportation costs on your tax return. At $0.70/mile, this adds up quickly</li>
    <li><strong>Deduct parking and tolls:</strong> If you pay for parking at the plasma center or tolls on your route, these are potentially deductible as income-producing expenses</li>
    <li><strong>Get a doctor's prescription for supplements you need medically:</strong> If you have a legitimate medical condition (iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency), get a prescription so HSA/FSA covers those specific supplements</li>
    <li><strong>Use HSA/FSA for unrelated medical expenses:</strong> Maximize your HSA/FSA for actual medical costs (dental, vision, prescriptions) to free up cash for plasma-related supplies</li>
    <li><strong>Buy supplements in bulk:</strong> If you purchase protein drinks, hydration mixes, or iron supplements for donation prep, buy in bulk from warehouse stores or Amazon to minimize per-unit cost</li>
    <li><strong>Choose the closest center:</strong> Reducing your round-trip distance saves gas money and increases the value of each donation visit</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Do NOT use HSA/FSA to buy hydration drinks "for donation":</strong> Liquid I.V., Pedialyte, and similar products are not qualified medical expenses unless prescribed by a doctor for a diagnosed condition like chronic dehydration</li>
    <li><strong>Do NOT submit plasma center mileage as medical mileage on your HSA:</strong> Driving to a plasma center is not a medical trip. Medical mileage is only for trips to doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies for your own healthcare</li>
    <li><strong>Do NOT purchase supplements through your HSA card without a prescription:</strong> Over-the-counter supplements require a prescription or LMN to qualify since the CARES Act of 2020. Simply having an HSA card does not make everything at the pharmacy eligible</li>
    <li><strong>Do NOT confuse tax deductions with HSA/FSA eligibility:</strong> Mileage to the plasma center may be tax-deductible, but it is NOT an HSA/FSA expense. These are two completely separate systems</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I use my HSA to buy supplements for plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Generally no. Dietary supplements like protein powder, multivitamins, and hydration mixes are not qualified HSA/FSA expenses unless prescribed by a doctor for a diagnosed medical condition. Buying iron supplements "to help with plasma screening" does not qualify. However, if your doctor diagnoses iron deficiency anemia and prescribes iron supplements, that prescription makes them HSA/FSA eligible regardless of whether you also donate plasma.</p>

<h3>Is driving to a plasma center covered by my HSA as medical mileage?</h3>
<p>No. HSA-eligible medical mileage only covers travel to receive medical care (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies). Driving to a plasma center is travel to earn income, not travel for your own medical treatment. However, plasma center mileage IS potentially deductible as an income-producing expense on your tax return &mdash; just through a different mechanism than HSA/FSA.</p>

<h3>Can I use FSA funds for Liquid I.V. or Pedialyte before plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Not typically. Hydration products like Liquid I.V. and Pedialyte are classified as general wellness or nutrition products, not medical treatments. They would only qualify if prescribed by a doctor for a specific medical condition such as chronic dehydration. Purchasing them for plasma donation preparation does not meet the IRS definition of a qualified medical expense.</p>

<h3>What plasma-related expenses CAN I deduct on my taxes?</h3>
<p>While HSA/FSA is generally off-limits for plasma expenses, you can potentially deduct mileage ($0.70/mile), parking fees, and tolls for traveling to the plasma center on your tax return. These are deducted as expenses related to producing taxable income, not as medical expenses. Keep a detailed mileage log with dates, destinations, and round-trip distances.</p>

<h3>If I get a medical complication from plasma donation, does my HSA cover treatment?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you experience a medical complication from plasma donation (vein infection, nerve injury, excessive bruising requiring medical attention), the doctor visits, prescriptions, and treatment costs are qualified medical expenses covered by your HSA or FSA. The treatment is for your health, which is exactly what these accounts are designed for.</p>
