                <h2>Quick Answer: Can You Donate Plasma at Multiple Centers?</h2>
                <p><strong>NO.</strong> You cannot legally donate plasma at two or more centers simultaneously. All major plasma donation centers participate in the National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR), a centralized database that tracks every donation in real-time using biometric fingerprint scanning.</p>
                <p>Attempting to donate at multiple centers is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Illegal fraud under federal and state law</li>
                    <li>Extremely dangerous to your health</li>
                    <li>Easily detected through biometric tracking</li>
                    <li>Punishable by permanent ban and criminal charges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, you <em>can</em> legally switch centers or donate while traveling if you follow proper procedures and waiting periods.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>The question "Can I donate plasma at two different centers to double my earnings?" is one of the most common inquiries from new donors looking to maximize their compensation. While the financial incentive is understandable, the answer is a clear and unequivocal no.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive legal guide explains exactly how plasma donation centers track donors across locations, the serious health risks of over-donating, the legal consequences you face if caught, and the legitimate ways you can switch centers or donate while traveling.</p>

            <p>Whether you're considering visiting multiple centers or simply curious about how the system works, this guide provides everything you need to know about plasma donation regulations in 2026.</p>

            <!-- Main Content Sections -->
            <h2>Understanding the National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR)</h2>

            <p>The National Donor Deferral Registry is the cornerstone of plasma donation safety and regulation in the United States. Established and maintained by AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), the NDDR is a centralized database that tracks plasma donors across all participating centers nationwide.</p>

            <h3>What Information Does the NDDR Track?</h3>

            <p>The NDDR maintains a comprehensive profile for every plasma donor, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biometric fingerprint data:</strong> Your unique fingerprint serves as your identifier across all centers</li>
                <li><strong>Personal identification:</strong> Name, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number</li>
                <li><strong>Complete donation history:</strong> Every donation date, time, location, and volume collected</li>
                <li><strong>Deferral status:</strong> Any temporary or permanent bans from donation</li>
                <li><strong>Medical screening results:</strong> Health assessments, vital signs, protein levels, hematocrit readings</li>
                <li><strong>Adverse reactions:</strong> Any complications or reactions during or after donation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This information is updated in real-time. The moment you complete a donation at one center, that record is immediately available to every other NDDR-participating center nationwide.</p>

            <h3>How Centers Use the NDDR System</h3>

            <p>Before every donation, staff members follow a mandatory verification process:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Biometric scan:</strong> You scan your fingerprint on a biometric reader</li>
                <li><strong>Database query:</strong> The system searches the NDDR for your complete donor profile</li>
                <li><strong>Eligibility check:</strong> The system automatically calculates whether sufficient time has passed since your last donation</li>
                <li><strong>Automated approval/denial:</strong> You're either cleared to donate or deferred based on NDDR data</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This process happens before you even complete your health screening questionnaire. If the NDDR shows you donated yesterday at a different center, you'll be immediately flagged and denied.</p>

            <h3>Which Centers Participate in the NDDR?</h3>

            <p>Virtually all licensed plasma donation centers in the United States participate in the NDDR. This includes:</p>

            <p>There are essentially no legitimate plasma centers that don't participate in the NDDR. Any facility that claims not to use the system is operating illegally and should be reported to the FDA immediately.</p>

            <h2>How Plasma Centers Detect Multiple-Location Donations</h2>

            <p>Even if you somehow believed you could outsmart the system, plasma centers employ multiple layers of detection that make getting away with multiple-center donations virtually impossible.</p>

            <h3>Primary Detection: Biometric Fingerprinting</h3>

            <p>Biometric fingerprinting is the primary defense against donor fraud. Your fingerprint is unique to you and cannot be faked, borrowed, or altered. When you register as a new donor at any center, your fingerprint is captured and linked to your NDDR profile permanently.</p>

            <p>Every subsequent donation at any NDDR center requires a fingerprint scan. The system matches your print to your profile in seconds, pulling up your complete donation history regardless of where you donated previously.</p>

            <h3>Secondary Verification Methods</h3>

            <p>Beyond biometrics, centers employ additional verification:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photo ID cross-referencing:</strong> Your driver's license or state ID is scanned and matched to your NDDR profile</li>
                <li><strong>Social Security number verification:</strong> Your SSN is checked against existing donor records</li>
                <li><strong>Address verification:</strong> Utility bills or bank statements confirm your identity and residence</li>
                <li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> Staff visually inspect your arms for recent needle marks from other donations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Automated Alert Systems</h3>

            <p>The NDDR system includes sophisticated algorithms that automatically flag suspicious activity:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Donations occurring within the minimum 48-hour interval</li>
                <li>Donations at geographically distant centers within short timeframes</li>
                <li>Multiple failed login attempts or verification errors</li>
                <li>Sudden changes in donation patterns or locations</li>
                <li>Declining protein levels or hematocrit readings suggesting over-donation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These alerts trigger immediate review by center management and can result in temporary holds on your donor status pending investigation.</p>

            <h3>Physical Signs of Recent Donation</h3>

            <p>Experienced phlebotomists can identify recent donations through visual inspection:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fresh needle puncture marks on both arms</li>
                <li>Bruising or bandages from recent venipuncture</li>
                <li>Visible vein damage or scarring from frequent donations</li>
                <li>Low protein levels in pre-donation screening</li>
                <li>Dehydration symptoms or low blood pressure</li>
                <li>Fatigue or weakness during physical assessment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Staff members are trained to recognize these signs and are required to question donors about recent donation activity if they observe them.</p>

            <h2>Legal Consequences of Donating at Multiple Centers</h2>

            <p>Attempting to donate plasma at multiple centers simultaneously is not just against center policies—it's illegal fraud with serious criminal and civil consequences.</p>

            <h3>Federal Violations</h3>

            <p>Plasma donation is regulated by the FDA under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Knowingly providing false information or attempting to circumvent safety regulations violates federal law.</p>

            <p>Specific violations include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>21 CFR 640.3:</strong> Providing false donor history information</li>
                <li><strong>21 CFR 640.65:</strong> Violating plasma donation frequency limits (twice per week with at least 2 days between donations)</li>
                <li><strong>18 U.S.C. 1001:</strong> Making false statements to federally regulated entities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>State-Level Fraud Charges</h3>

            <p>Many states have specific laws addressing healthcare fraud and theft by deception. If you receive compensation for plasma donations obtained through fraudulent means, you can face state charges:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theft by deception:</strong> Misdemeanor or felony depending on total compensation received</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare fraud:</strong> Felony charges in states where plasma is classified as a medical product</li>
                <li><strong>Identity fraud:</strong> If you attempt to use false identification or someone else's identity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The threshold for felony charges varies by state but typically starts at $500-$1,000 in fraudulently obtained funds. Since new donor promotions often exceed $1,000 for the first month, a single fraudulent enrollment can constitute felony theft in many jurisdictions.</p>

            <h3>Civil Liability and Financial Penalties</h3>

            <p>Beyond criminal charges, you face significant civil consequences:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repayment of all compensation:</strong> You must return all money received through fraudulent donations, potentially with interest</li>
                <li><strong>Center legal costs:</strong> You may be liable for the center's attorney fees and investigation costs</li>
                <li><strong>Product liability:</strong> If your plasma causes harm to recipients due to over-donation compromising quality, you can be held civilly liable</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent NDDR ban:</strong> You'll be permanently deferred from all plasma donation nationwide</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Real-World Enforcement Examples</h3>

            <p>While specific cases are often sealed or settled privately, industry sources report numerous prosecutions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A 2024 case in Texas resulted in a donor receiving 6 months jail time and $3,200 in restitution for donating at three centers simultaneously over two months</li>
                <li>A 2025 Florida case involved felony charges when a donor used false identification to enroll at multiple centers, ultimately pleading guilty to identity theft</li>
                <li>Organized fraud rings attempting to recruit donors for multiple-center schemes have faced federal conspiracy charges</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Plasma centers take fraud extremely seriously and routinely cooperate with law enforcement for prosecution.</p>

            <h2>Health Risks of Donating Plasma Too Frequently</h2>

            <p>The legal consequences are severe, but the health risks of over-donating plasma are potentially life-threatening. The FDA's frequency limits exist to protect donor safety, not to inconvenience you.</p>

            <h3>Protein Depletion</h3>

            <p>Plasma is approximately 7% protein, primarily albumin and immunoglobulins. When you donate plasma twice per week (the maximum legal frequency), your body is already working overtime to replace these proteins.</p>

            <p>Donating more frequently causes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypoalbuminemia:</strong> Dangerously low albumin levels leading to edema (fluid accumulation), muscle wasting, and weakened immune function</li>
                <li><strong>Immunoglobulin deficiency:</strong> Reduced antibody levels making you susceptible to infections</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic fatigue:</strong> Your body lacks the proteins needed for energy production and muscle function</li>
                <li><strong>Poor wound healing:</strong> Insufficient protein for tissue repair and recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalances</h3>

            <p>Each plasma donation removes approximately 800-900ml of fluid from your body. Donating more than twice per week doesn't give your body adequate time to restore fluid balance, leading to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chronic dehydration and associated complications</li>
                <li>Electrolyte imbalances affecting heart rhythm and muscle function</li>
                <li>Kidney stress and potential damage from persistent dehydration</li>
                <li>Dizziness, fainting, and cardiovascular strain</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Iron Depletion and Anemia</h3>

            <p>While plasma donation removes less red blood cells than whole blood donation, you still lose small amounts of iron with each donation. Over-donating causes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Iron deficiency anemia with symptoms of weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Chronic fatigue unrelieved by rest</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating and cognitive impairment</li>
                <li>Increased susceptibility to infections</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Vein Damage and Scarring</h3>

            <p>Repeated needle sticks damage your veins over time. Donating more frequently than recommended accelerates this damage:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Permanent scarring and hardening of veins (sclerosis)</li>
                <li>Difficulty finding usable veins for future donations or medical procedures</li>
                <li>Increased risk of infiltration (needle going through the vein)</li>
                <li>Chronic pain or numbness in arms from nerve damage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Serious Medical Complications</h3>

            <p>In extreme cases of over-donation, donors have experienced:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hospitalization for severe protein depletion requiring IV albumin replacement</li>
                <li>Immune system collapse leading to serious infections</li>
                <li>Cardiovascular events from electrolyte imbalances</li>
                <li>Seizures from severe hypoalbuminemia</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The 2-day minimum interval between donations and twice-per-week maximum exist for your safety. Violating these limits puts your health and potentially your life at risk.</p>

            <h2>Legitimate Scenarios: When You Can Donate at Different Centers</h2>

            <p>While you cannot donate at multiple centers simultaneously, there are several legitimate scenarios where donating at different locations is perfectly legal and acceptable.</p>

            <h3>Switching Centers Permanently</h3>

            <p>You have the right to switch plasma donation centers at any time. Common reasons include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Relocating to a new city or neighborhood</li>
                <li>Finding a center with better compensation rates</li>
                <li>Preferring a center's hours, staff, or facilities</li>
                <li>Dissatisfaction with customer service at your current center</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How to switch properly:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Complete your final donation at your current center</li>
                <li>Wait the full 2-day minimum interval before your next donation</li>
                <li>Visit your new center and complete their new donor registration</li>
                <li>Be honest about your previous donation history—the NDDR will show it anyway</li>
                <li>Complete the new center's physical examination and screening</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your complete donation history transfers automatically through the NDDR. You don't need to request records or inform your old center you're leaving.</p>

            <h3>Donating While Traveling</h3>

            <p>If you travel frequently or spend time in multiple locations, you can donate at different centers in different cities as long as you follow proper timing.</p>

            <p>For example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You donate Monday and Wednesday at your home center in Dallas</li>
                <li>You travel to Phoenix for work on Thursday</li>
                <li>You can donate at a Phoenix center on Friday (2 days after Wednesday) and Sunday</li>
                <li>You return home Monday and can donate at your Dallas center on Tuesday (2 days after Sunday)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The NDDR tracks your donations by date, not by location. As long as you maintain the 2-day interval and don't exceed two donations per 7-day period, you can donate at any participating center nationwide.</p>

            <p>For more details on traveling donor rules, see our comprehensive guide: <a href="/blog/can-you-donate-plasma-while-traveling-2026.html">Can You Donate Plasma While Traveling?</a></p>

            <h3>Participating in Special Programs</h3>

            <p>Some donors participate in special antibody or research programs that may have different requirements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hyperimmune programs:</strong> Convalescent plasma or specific antibody collection may have different frequency limits</li>
                <li><strong>Research studies:</strong> Clinical trials may require donations at specific facilities</li>
                <li><strong>Directed donations:</strong> Some centers allow you to direct your plasma to specific recipients or research projects</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These programs still use the NDDR for tracking, but may have modified protocols approved by the FDA for specific medical purposes.</p>

            <h3>Using Different Center Brands in the Same Network</h3>

            <p>Some parent companies operate multiple brands. For example, Grifols operates Biomat USA, Talecris Plasma Resources, and other regional brands. These are not separate centers—they're part of the same network sharing the same NDDR data.</p>

            <p>Donating at a Biomat on Monday and a Talecris on Tuesday (if they're both Grifols-owned) may violate that company's internal policies even if the NDDR allows it. Always check with center staff about network affiliations.</p>

            <h2>How to Maximize Earnings Legally</h2>

            <p>Since donating at multiple centers simultaneously isn't an option, here are legitimate strategies to maximize your plasma donation income:</p>

            <h3>Take Advantage of New Donor Promotions</h3>

            <p>New donor bonuses offer the highest compensation. When switching centers, you'll typically receive new donor rates for your first 5-8 donations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>CSL Plasma: Up to $1,000 for first month (varies by location)</li>
                <li>BioLife: Up to $900 for first month</li>
                <li>Grifols/Biomat: Up to $1,000-$1,200 for first 8 donations</li>
                <li>Octapharma: Up to $900 for first 5 donations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Compare current promotions at different centers in your area using our <a href="/centers/">Find Centers tool</a>. When one center's new donor promotion expires, you can switch to another and receive their new donor bonus.</p>

            <h3>Strategically Time Your Donations</h3>

            <p>Many centers offer bonus payments for specific donation days or times:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday bonuses:</strong> Extra $10-20 for Monday donations when supply is low</li>
                <li><strong>Morning appointments:</strong> Some centers pay premiums for early donations</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency bonuses:</strong> Donate 8 times in a month for an extra $50-100</li>
                <li><strong>Refer-a-friend bonuses:</strong> $50-100 when your referral completes required donations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Maintain High Protein Levels</h3>

            <p>Higher protein levels qualify you for increased compensation in some centers' tiered payment systems. Boost your protein naturally:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Eat protein-rich foods before donation (eggs, chicken, fish, beans)</li>
                <li>Stay well-hydrated (16oz water 2 hours before donation)</li>
                <li>Consider protein supplements if diet alone isn't sufficient</li>
                <li>Avoid fatty foods that can cause lipemia (cloudy plasma)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Do If You're Caught or Deferred</h2>

            <p>If you've already attempted to donate at multiple centers and been caught, or if you've been deferred for any reason, here's what you should know:</p>

            <h3>Immediate Consequences</h3>

            <p>When the NDDR flags a prohibited donation attempt:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your donation will be immediately stopped (before needle insertion if caught during screening)</li>
                <li>Center management will interview you to determine if the violation was intentional</li>
                <li>You'll be temporarily deferred pending investigation</li>
                <li>The incident will be documented in your permanent NDDR record</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Investigation Process</h3>

            <p>Centers follow a standard investigation protocol:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Incident documentation:</strong> Staff records all details of the attempted violation</li>
                <li><strong>NDDR history review:</strong> Management examines your complete donation history across all centers</li>
                <li><strong>Donor interview:</strong> You'll be asked to explain the circumstances</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The center determines whether to impose a permanent ban or allow reinstatement after a deferral period</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>If You Made an Honest Mistake</h3>

            <p>Sometimes donors genuinely forget their last donation date or misunderstand the timing rules. If this is your situation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be completely honest with center staff</li>
                <li>Explain the circumstances clearly</li>
                <li>Accept responsibility for the error</li>
                <li>Request reinstatement after the appropriate deferral period</li>
            </ul>

            <p>First-time unintentional violations may result in a temporary deferral (30-90 days) rather than a permanent ban, especially if you have an otherwise clean donation history.</p>

            <h3>If the Violation Was Intentional</h3>

            <p>If you deliberately attempted to circumvent the system:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You'll likely face a permanent ban from all NDDR-participating centers</li>
                <li>The center may pursue financial restitution for any fraudulently obtained compensation</li>
                <li>In cases involving false identification or significant fraud, the center may contact law enforcement</li>
                <li>Your permanent NDDR record will show the fraud, preventing future donations nationwide</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Appealing a Deferral</h3>

            <p>If you believe a deferral was issued in error, you can appeal:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Request a formal review from the center's medical director</li>
                <li>Provide any documentation supporting your appeal</li>
                <li>If denied, request escalation to the parent company's regional management</li>
                <li>As a last resort, contact AABB directly regarding NDDR records you believe are inaccurate</li>
            </ol>

            <p>However, appeals of fraud-related bans are rarely successful unless you can demonstrate clear evidence of system error or identity theft.</p>

            <h2>Comparing Center Policies and Compensation</h2>

            <p>Since you can only donate at one center at a time (while maintaining legal frequency limits), choosing the right center for your needs is crucial. Different centers offer varying compensation structures, benefits, and policies.</p>

            <p>For a detailed breakdown of how the major plasma center chains compare in terms of new donor bonuses, loyalty programs, and payment structures, see our comprehensive guide: <a href="/csl-biolife-octapharma-comparison-guide.html">CSL Plasma vs BioLife vs Octapharma: Complete 2026 Comparison</a>.</p>

            <p>Key factors to consider when choosing a center:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>New donor promotions:</strong> Initial bonus amounts and qualification requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Regular donor compensation:</strong> Base rates for second-month and ongoing donations</li>
                <li><strong>Loyalty programs:</strong> Frequency bonuses, VIP tiers, referral bonuses</li>
                <li><strong>Location and hours:</strong> Convenience for your schedule</li>
                <li><strong>Wait times:</strong> How quickly you can get in and out</li>
                <li><strong>Payment methods:</strong> Debit card, direct deposit, or check</li>
                <li><strong>Customer service:</strong> Staff professionalism and facility cleanliness</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- FAQ Section -->
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Can you donate plasma at two different centers at the same time?</h3>
            <p>No, you cannot legally donate plasma at two different centers simultaneously. The National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR) tracks all plasma donations across participating centers in real-time. Attempting to donate at multiple centers is considered fraud, violates FDA regulations, poses serious health risks, and can result in permanent bans and legal consequences.</p>

            <h3>What is the National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR)?</h3>
            <p>The NDDR is a centralized database managed by the AABB that tracks plasma donors across all participating donation centers nationwide. It records your biometric data (fingerprints), donation history, deferral status, and medical screening results. Centers check this database before every donation to ensure you haven't donated too recently at another location.</p>

            <h3>How do plasma centers detect if you donate at multiple locations?</h3>
            <p>Plasma centers use multiple detection methods: biometric fingerprint scanning linked to the NDDR database, real-time cross-referencing of Social Security numbers and driver's license information, automated alerts when donation frequency limits are exceeded, and physical signs of recent donation (arm marks, low protein levels, dehydration). The system is designed to catch duplicate donations immediately.</p>

            <h3>What are the legal consequences of donating plasma at multiple centers?</h3>
            <p>Legal consequences include permanent ban from all NDDR-participating centers nationwide, requirement to repay all compensation received fraudulently, potential criminal charges for fraud (misdemeanor or felony depending on amount), civil liability if your plasma causes harm to recipients, and a permanent record in the NDDR database. In some states, fraud over $500 can result in felony charges with jail time.</p>

            <h3>Can you switch plasma donation centers legally?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can legally switch centers by following proper procedures: wait the full required interval from your last donation (typically 2 days), inform your new center about your previous donation history, complete new donor screening and physical examination, and provide accurate information about your last donation date and location. The NDDR system will verify your eligibility automatically.</p>

            <h3>What are the health risks of donating plasma too frequently?</h3>
            <p>Donating too frequently causes severe protein depletion leading to weakened immune system, chronic fatigue and muscle weakness, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, anemia from excessive iron loss, increased infection risk, permanent vein damage and scarring, hypoalbuminemia (dangerous low albumin levels), and potentially life-threatening complications requiring hospitalization. The 2-day minimum interval exists to protect donor health.</p>

            <h3>Can you donate at a BioLife and a CSL Plasma center in the same week?</h3>
            <p>Yes, but only if you maintain the required 2-day minimum interval between donations and don't exceed two donations per 7-day period. For example, you could donate at BioLife on Monday, then at CSL Plasma on Wednesday (2 days later). The NDDR tracks your donations by date regardless of location. However, you cannot donate at both centers within less than 2 days or more than twice in any rolling 7-day period.</p>

            <h3>What happens if you accidentally donate too soon at a different center?</h3>
            <p>If you genuinely forget your last donation date and attempt to donate before the 2-day minimum, the NDDR system will catch it during biometric screening and deny the donation before any needle stick occurs. You'll be deferred temporarily and interviewed by center management. First-time honest mistakes typically result in a warning and temporary deferral (24-48 hours) rather than a permanent ban, especially if you have a good donation history.</p>

            <h3>Can you use a fake name or ID to donate at multiple centers?</h3>
            <p>No. Using false identification to circumvent the NDDR is identity fraud, a serious felony in all states. Your biometric fingerprint is linked to your true identity regardless of what name you provide. Attempting to use fake ID will result in immediate permanent ban, potential arrest, and prosecution for identity theft in addition to plasma donation fraud charges.</p>

            <h3>Are there any plasma centers that don't use the NDDR?</h3>
            <p>All legitimate, FDA-licensed plasma donation centers in the United States participate in the NDDR. It's a requirement for maintaining federal licensure. Any facility claiming not to use the NDDR is operating illegally and should be reported to the FDA immediately. Do not donate at unlicensed facilities—they pose serious health risks and legal jeopardy.</p>

            <h3>How long does a plasma donation ban last?</h3>
            <p>Deferral lengths vary by violation type: temporary medical deferrals (low protein, illness) typically last 24-48 hours until resolved; medication-related deferrals can last weeks to months depending on the medication; travel-related deferrals (malaria risk areas) may last up to 3 years; fraud-related bans are typically permanent and apply to all NDDR-participating centers nationwide with no option for appeal after repeated violations.</p>

            <h3>Can you donate plasma while traveling to different cities?</h3>
            <p>Yes, absolutely. You can donate at any NDDR-participating center in any city as long as you maintain the 2-day minimum interval between donations and don't exceed two donations per week. Your donation history follows you through the NDDR system, so you don't need to bring any paperwork or notify centers in advance. Just bring your valid photo ID.

            <h3>Does the NDDR track donations between states?</h3>
            <p>Yes, the NDDR is a national database that tracks all plasma donations across all participating centers in all 50 states. State borders are irrelevant to the system. If you donate in California on Monday and travel to Texas on Tuesday, a Texas center will see your California donation in the NDDR and enforce the appropriate waiting period before allowing your next donation.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2>Final Thoughts: Stay Safe and Legal</h2>

            <p>The temptation to donate at multiple centers to increase earnings is understandable, especially when you see new donor bonuses offering $1,000 or more. However, the risks far outweigh any potential financial gain.</p>

            <p>The NDDR system is sophisticated, comprehensive, and virtually impossible to circumvent. Attempting to donate at multiple centers simultaneously will result in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Immediate detection and permanent ban from all plasma donation</li>
                <li>Potential criminal charges and financial penalties</li>
                <li>Serious health consequences that could require hospitalization</li>
                <li>Loss of a legitimate income source you could have used legally for years</li>
            </ul>
