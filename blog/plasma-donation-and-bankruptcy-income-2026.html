<h3>Quick Answer</h3>
<p>Plasma donation income <strong>must be reported on bankruptcy filings</strong> and can affect your case in different ways depending on the chapter. For <strong>Chapter 7</strong>, plasma income factors into the means test that determines eligibility, but typical plasma earnings ($250-$600/month) rarely push anyone over the threshold alone. For <strong>Chapter 13</strong>, plasma income is included in your disposable income calculation, which can increase your monthly payment to creditors. In both cases, <strong>failure to disclose plasma income can result in case dismissal or denial of discharge.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article provides general educational information. Bankruptcy law is complex and varies by jurisdiction. Always consult a qualified bankruptcy attorney before making decisions about filing. Many offer free initial consultations.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: How Plasma Income Affects the Means Test</h2>

<p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers a fresh start by liquidating non-exempt assets to pay creditors, then discharging most remaining debts. Not everyone qualifies. The primary gatekeeper is the <strong>means test</strong>, which compares your income to the median income in your state.</p>

<h3>How the Means Test Works</h3>
<p>The means test (Form 122A) calculates your <strong>current monthly income (CMI)</strong> by averaging your gross income from all sources over the <strong>6 full calendar months before your filing date</strong>. This is then annualized and compared to the median income for your household size in your state.</p>

<p>If your annualized CMI is below the state median, you pass the means test and can file Chapter 7. If it is above, you move to Part 2 of the test, which deducts allowed expenses to determine if you have enough disposable income to fund a Chapter 13 plan.</p>

<p><strong>Where plasma income fits in:</strong> Every dollar of plasma income during those 6 months gets included in your CMI calculation. Here is a concrete example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employment income: $2,800/month</li>
<li>Plasma income: $450/month (donating twice weekly at a center paying $55-$65 per donation)</li>
<li>Total monthly income for means test: $3,250</li>
<li>Annualized: $39,000</li>
<li>State median for household of 1 (example: Ohio): $56,847</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example, even with plasma income included, the debtor is well below the median and passes the means test easily. This is the reality for most plasma donors. The $5,400/year that a regular donor might earn from plasma is rarely the difference between qualifying and not qualifying for Chapter 7.</p>

<h3>The 6-Month Lookback Window Matters</h3>
<p>Because the means test uses a specific 6-month window, the timing of your filing matters. If you earned significantly more from plasma during certain months (say, during a new donor bonus period where you were earning $100-$125 per visit instead of the usual $55-$65), those high-earning months inflate your CMI.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you stopped donating 3 months ago, only the months you were donating would count, and the other months would show $0 in plasma income, bringing down your average. This is not manipulation; it is simply how the math works.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13 Bankruptcy: Plasma Income and Repayment Plans</h2>

<p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy works fundamentally differently from Chapter 7. Instead of liquidating assets, you enter a 3-5 year repayment plan where you pay creditors from your disposable income. The court approves a monthly payment amount based on your income minus allowed expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Here is where plasma income gets more complicated.</strong></p>

<p>In Chapter 13, the trustee cares about your <strong>ongoing income</strong>, not just a snapshot. Your repayment plan must commit all "projected disposable income" to creditor payments. If you are donating plasma and earning $400/month, that $400 is part of your disposable income calculation.</p>

<p>Let us run the numbers for a typical scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly employment income: $3,200</li>
<li>Monthly plasma income: $400</li>
<li>Total income: $3,600</li>
<li>Allowed expenses (housing, food, transportation, etc.): $3,100</li>
<li>Disposable income: $500/month</li>
<li>Without plasma: disposable income would be $100/month</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example, plasma income quintuple your monthly payment to creditors. Over a 5-year plan, that is $30,000 vs. $6,000 paid to creditors. This is a massive difference and something you need to discuss with your attorney before filing.</p>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-radius: 12px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border: 1px solid #fbbf24;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #92400e;">Key Chapter 13 Consideration</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you start donating plasma <em>after</em> your Chapter 13 plan is confirmed, the trustee can file a motion to modify your plan to capture the additional income. You are required to report significant income changes. Some districts require annual tax returns and income updates throughout the plan period.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="trustee-claims">Can the Trustee Claim Your Plasma Income?</h2>

<h3>Chapter 7 Trustee</h3>
<p>In Chapter 7, the trustee's job is to liquidate non-exempt assets. Post-filing income is generally <strong>not part of the bankruptcy estate</strong> (with some exceptions for income earned within 180 days of filing from certain sources). This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plasma income you earn <em>after</em> your Chapter 7 filing date is yours to keep</li>
<li>Plasma income sitting on a prepaid card on the filing date is technically an asset that should be listed on Schedule B</li>
<li>Most states have cash exemptions that would protect small balances on prepaid cards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 13 Trustee</h3>
<p>The Chapter 13 trustee has broader reach. Because the plan is based on your disposable income, the trustee monitors your finances throughout the 3-5 year plan. Plasma income is fair game for creditor payments. The trustee can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include plasma income in the initial plan calculation</li>
<li>Request plan modification if you start donating or increase donations</li>
<li>Review your tax returns annually to verify income reporting</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="reporting">Reporting Requirements: Full Disclosure Is Non-Negotiable</h2>

<p>Bankruptcy filings require complete financial disclosure. Here is exactly where plasma income must appear:</p>

<p><strong>Schedule I (Current Income of Individual Debtor):</strong> Line 8a asks for income from "a business, profession, or farm." If you report plasma as self-employment on Schedule C of your tax return, it goes here. Line 8c provides space for "all other income regularly received." Plasma income fits either category.</p>

<p><strong>Form 122A (Means Test for Chapter 7) or Form 122C (for Chapter 13):</strong> Line 5 of the means test asks about "gross income from the operation of a business, profession, or farm." Plasma income goes here if treated as self-employment. There is also a catch-all line for "any other income."</p>

<p><strong>Statement of Financial Affairs (SOFA):</strong> Question 4 asks about income from all sources for the current and two prior years. Plasma income must be included.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if you do not disclose it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your discharge can be revoked even after the case is closed</li>
<li>You can face criminal penalties for bankruptcy fraud (18 U.S.C. Section 152)</li>
<li>Your case can be dismissed with prejudice, meaning you cannot refile</li>
<li>The trustee can reopen a closed case if undisclosed income is discovered later</li>
</ul>

<p>Trustees and the U.S. Trustee's office have access to IRS data. If a plasma center filed a 1099-NEC with the IRS showing you earned $4,000 and your bankruptcy schedules do not reflect that income, you will have a serious problem.</p>

<h2 id="timing">Strategic Timing Considerations</h2>

<p>The timing of your bankruptcy filing relative to your plasma donation activity matters, particularly for Chapter 7. Here are legitimate strategies to discuss with your attorney:</p>

<p><strong>Filing after a period of reduced donations:</strong> If you have naturally reduced your donation frequency (perhaps due to health, schedule changes, or vein recovery needs), your 6-month average income will be lower. This is not manipulation; it reflects your actual financial situation. However, do not artificially stop donating just to game the means test, as this could be seen as bad faith.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding new donor bonus periods:</strong> If you recently started donating and received the elevated new donor rates ($100-$125/visit for the first 8-10 visits), those months disproportionately inflate your income. Waiting until you have been on regular rates for 6 months gives a more accurate picture of your ongoing income.</p>

<p><strong>Accounting for expenses:</strong> On the means test, you can deduct business expenses against self-employment income. Mileage to the plasma center at the IRS rate, parking, and other documented expenses reduce the income figure used in the calculation.</p>

<h2 id="prepaid-cards">Prepaid Debit Cards and Asset Reporting</h2>

<p>A unique aspect of plasma donation income is that most centers pay via prepaid debit cards. On your bankruptcy filing date, any balance on these cards is technically a financial asset that must be disclosed on <strong>Schedule B (Personal Property)</strong>.</p>

<p>Practically speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances on prepaid cards are typically small (most donors spend their plasma earnings quickly)</li>
<li>Most states have cash or personal property exemptions that would cover modest prepaid card balances</li>
<li>The federal exemption for "any property" under 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d)(5) can also protect small balances</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a significant balance accumulated on a plasma payment card, consider spending it on exempt necessities (groceries, utilities, medical expenses) before filing. This is legitimate pre-bankruptcy planning, not fraud, as long as you are spending on genuine needs rather than converting non-exempt assets.</p>

<h2 id="during-case">Donating Plasma During an Open Bankruptcy Case</h2>

<h3>During Chapter 7</h3>
<p>Chapter 7 cases typically last 3-4 months from filing to discharge. You can continue donating plasma during this period. Post-petition income generally is not part of the bankruptcy estate. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue reporting accurately if asked by the trustee</li>
<li>Keep records of all donations and payments</li>
<li>Do not accumulate large balances on prepaid cards during the case</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Chapter 13</h3>
<p>You can donate plasma during your Chapter 13 plan, but the income will be monitored. If you were not donating when the plan was confirmed and you start, the trustee may seek a plan modification. Conversely, if you were donating and must stop (for medical reasons, for example), you can request a plan modification to lower your payments.</p>

<h2 id="practical">Practical Advice for Donors Considering Bankruptcy</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Consult a bankruptcy attorney early.</strong> Many offer free consultations. Discuss your plasma income specifically and how it affects your options.</li>
<li><strong>Keep detailed records.</strong> Document every donation, every payment received, and every expense related to donating. This shows the court you are transparent and organized.</li>
<li><strong>Do not stop donating just to manipulate the means test.</strong> This can backfire if the trustee argues bad faith.</li>
<li><strong>Consider whether Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is better given your plasma income.</strong> If plasma income significantly increases your Chapter 13 payment, and you qualify for Chapter 7 even with it, Chapter 7 may be the better option.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that plasma income is temporary and variable.</strong> Argue to the court that plasma income is not guaranteed, regular employment income. Your body imposes natural limits on how long and how frequently you can donate.</li>
<li><strong>Track deductible expenses aggressively.</strong> Mileage, supplies, and other costs offset plasma income on both the means test and Chapter 13 disposable income calculations.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I donate plasma to help pay my bankruptcy attorney?</h3>
<p>Yes. Attorney fees for bankruptcy are a legitimate expense. Many people use plasma income to save up for filing fees ($338 for Chapter 7, $313 for Chapter 13 as of 2026) and attorney costs ($1,000-$3,500 depending on chapter and complexity). Just be sure to disclose the income on your schedules.</p>

<h3>Will the trustee contact my plasma center?</h3>
<p>Unlikely in a straightforward case. However, trustees have the authority to subpoena records from third parties, including plasma centers. If there is a discrepancy between your reported income and what the trustee suspects, they may investigate.</p>

<h3>Can I exempt my plasma prepaid card balance?</h3>
<p>Yes, in most cases. Small balances on prepaid cards fall under cash or personal property exemptions available in every state. Federal exemptions under Section 522(d)(5) provide a wildcard exemption that can also cover these funds.</p>

<h3>What if I earned plasma income but did not report it on my taxes?</h3>
<p>You have a dual problem. First, you have unreported taxable income (an IRS issue). Second, if the IRS later audits you and assesses additional tax, that tax debt may not be dischargeable in bankruptcy if it involves fraud. File amended returns to correct the record before filing bankruptcy if possible.</p>

<h3>Does the automatic stay protect my plasma income from creditors?</h3>
<p>Yes. Once you file bankruptcy, the automatic stay prevents creditors from taking collection action against you or your property, including income. However, certain debts like child support are excepted from the stay, meaning garnishment for those obligations can continue.</p>
