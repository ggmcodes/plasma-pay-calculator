<h3>Quick Answer</h3>
<p><strong>Plasma donation income is taxable at the federal level regardless of the amount.</strong> If a single center pays you $600 or more in a calendar year, they are required to send you a 1099-MISC. Even if you earn less than $600 and do not receive a 1099, the IRS still expects you to report the income. State tax obligations vary &mdash; seven states have no income tax at all, while others piggyback on federal reporting rules.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="federal-rules">Federal IRS Rules for Plasma Income</h2>

<p>The IRS considers plasma compensation <strong>"other income"</strong> &mdash; not wages, not self-employment income. This classification affects how you report it and what taxes you owe.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tax Category</th><th>Applies to Plasma?</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Federal Income Tax</td><td>Yes</td><td>Reported as "other income" on Line 8 of Schedule 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Self-Employment Tax (15.3%)</td><td>Generally No</td><td>Plasma donation is not a trade or business for most donors</td></tr>
<tr><td>State Income Tax</td><td>Depends on state</td><td>7 states have no income tax; others follow federal rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Security / Medicare</td><td>No</td><td>Not subject to FICA withholding</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Effective Tax Rate on Plasma Income</h3>
<p>Because plasma income is "other income" and not self-employment income, most donors only owe <strong>federal income tax</strong> (10-22% for typical plasma donor income levels) plus any applicable state tax. You do NOT owe the 15.3% self-employment tax that gig workers pay.</p>

<h2 id="1099-threshold">The $600 Threshold Explained</h2>

<p>Plasma centers must file a <strong>1099-MISC</strong> with the IRS for any donor who receives $600 or more from that single center in a calendar year.</p>

<h3>What Triggers a 1099</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$600+ from one center:</strong> You will receive a 1099-MISC by January 31 of the following year</li>
<li><strong>Under $600 from one center:</strong> No 1099 issued, but income is still taxable</li>
<li><strong>Multiple centers:</strong> Each center tracks its own $600 threshold independently</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Scenarios</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Center A Pays</th><th>Center B Pays</th><th>1099 Received?</th><th>Must Report?</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Single center, regular donor</td><td>$5,200</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>Yes (from A)</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two centers, split income</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$2,500</td><td>Yes (both)</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Casual donor</td><td>$400</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>No</td><td>Yes (still taxable)</td></tr>
<tr><td>New donor, switched centers</td><td>$500</td><td>$700</td><td>Yes (from B only)</td><td>Yes (both amounts)</td></tr>
</tbody>

<h2 id="state-specifics">State-Specific Requirements</h2>

<h3>No State Income Tax (7 States)</h3>
<p>If you live in one of these states, you only owe federal tax on plasma income:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texas</strong> &mdash; No state income tax. Report federally only.</li>
<li><strong>Florida</strong> &mdash; No state income tax. Report federally only.</li>
<li><strong>Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, Washington</strong> &mdash; Same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tennessee and New Hampshire previously taxed only interest/dividend income but have fully phased out those taxes by 2026.</p>

<h3>California</h3>
<p>California's Franchise Tax Board (FTB) follows federal income definitions. Plasma income reported on your federal return flows through to your California return. California's marginal rates range from 1% to 13.3%, though most plasma donors fall in the 1-4% bracket on this income alone. No special plasma-specific reporting form exists.</p>

<h3>New York</h3>
<p>New York State and New York City both tax "other income" that appears on your federal return. NYC residents face a combined state+city rate of 7-10% on top of federal taxes. Report plasma income on Form IT-201 in the same manner as your federal return.</p>

<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p>Illinois uses a flat 4.95% income tax rate. All income reported federally is subject to Illinois tax. Plasma income flows through from your federal AGI to your IL-1040.</p>

<h3>Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan</h3>
<p>These states have unique rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ohio:</strong> Municipal income taxes may apply in some cities (0.5-3%). Check if your city taxes "other income."</li>
<li><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Flat 3.07% rate on taxable income. Plasma income is included.</li>
<li><strong>Michigan:</strong> Flat 4.25% rate. Some cities levy additional local income tax (Detroit: 2.4%).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-report">How to Report on Your Tax Return</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Gather your 1099-MISC forms</strong> from each plasma center (received by January 31).</li>
<li><strong>Add up total plasma income</strong> from all centers, including amounts under $600 for which you did not receive a 1099.</li>
<li><strong>Report on Schedule 1, Line 8z</strong> as "Other Income" with the description "Plasma donation compensation."</li>
<li><strong>The total flows to Form 1040, Line 8</strong> and is included in your Adjusted Gross Income.</li>
<li><strong>File your state return</strong> following your state's instructions for "other income."</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deductions">Deductions You Can Claim</h2>

<p>While plasma income is taxable, you may be able to offset some of it with legitimate deductions:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Deduction</th><th>Eligible?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Mileage to/from center</td><td>Possibly</td><td>Only if reporting as miscellaneous itemized; consult a tax professional</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parking fees at center</td><td>Possibly</td><td>Keep receipts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplements/hydration products</td><td>Unlikely</td><td>Hard to prove direct connection</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standard deduction</td><td>Yes</td><td>$15,000 single / $30,000 married filing jointly (2026)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Because plasma income is "other income" and not self-employment income, you generally cannot deduct expenses on Schedule C. Consult a tax professional about your specific situation.</p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not reporting income under $600:</strong> The IRS expects you to report ALL income, not just amounts on 1099 forms.</li>
<li><strong>Filing as self-employment:</strong> Unless you are donating at an extraordinary frequency as a business, Schedule C is not appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring state obligations:</strong> Just because you have no state income tax does not mean you can skip the federal return.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting municipal taxes:</strong> In Ohio, Michigan, and other states with local income taxes, plasma income may be subject to city tax.</li>
<li><strong>Not keeping records:</strong> Without a log of donations, reconstructing your annual income at tax time is difficult.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do I have to pay taxes on plasma donation income?</h3>
<p>Yes. The IRS considers plasma compensation taxable "other income" regardless of the amount. Even if you earn less than $600 and do not receive a 1099-MISC, you are legally required to report and pay taxes on the income.</p>

<h3>What happens if I don't report plasma income?</h3>
<p>If a center files a 1099-MISC with the IRS and you do not report that income, you will likely receive a CP2000 notice proposing additional tax, plus penalties and interest. Even without a 1099, unreported income carries the risk of audit penalties.</p>

<h3>Do I owe self-employment tax on plasma income?</h3>
<p>Generally no. Plasma donation is not a trade or business for most donors, so the 15.3% self-employment tax does not apply. You owe only federal income tax (and state tax if applicable). However, if the IRS determines you are operating plasma donation as a business, SE tax could apply.</p>

<h3>Which states have no income tax on plasma donations?</h3>
<p>Seven states have no state income tax at all: Texas, Florida, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, and Washington. Residents of these states only owe federal income tax on plasma earnings.</p>

<h3>Can I deduct mileage driving to the plasma center?</h3>
<p>Possibly, but it is complicated. Because plasma income is "other income" (not self-employment), you cannot use Schedule C to deduct mileage. Some tax professionals argue for itemized miscellaneous deductions, but the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended most miscellaneous deductions through 2025. Consult a tax professional for 2026 guidance.</p>
