<div style="background: #dcfce7; border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; padding: 1.25rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;" id="quick-answer">
<h3 style="color: #166534; margin-top: 0;">Quick Answer: Can You Donate Plasma With a Fever?</h3>
<p><strong>No, not if your temperature is 99.5°F or higher.</strong> The FDA sets a hard cutoff of 99.5°F (37.5°C) for plasma donors. If you have an active fever or your oral temperature is above 99.5°F, you will be deferred from donation. After your fever breaks, most centers require 24-48 hours of being fever-free (without fever-reducing medications) before you can donate again.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="temperature-limits">FDA Temperature Limits and Donation Requirements</h2>

<p>Temperature screening is one of the first checks you undergo at any plasma donation center. The threshold is strict and science-based.</p>

<h3>Temperature Cutoff Rules</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Temperature Range (Oral)</th><th>Fahrenheit</th><th>Celsius</th><th>Donation Eligibility</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Normal body temperature</td><td>98.6°F or lower</td><td>37°C or lower</td><td>Eligible to donate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Borderline — low-grade "fever"</td><td>99.0–99.4°F</td><td>37.2–37.4°C</td><td>Often deferred; depends on center policy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fever — FDA cutoff</td><td>99.5°F or higher</td><td>37.5°C or higher</td><td>Automatic deferral</td></tr>
<tr><td>High fever</td><td>101.0°F or higher</td><td>38.3°C or higher</td><td>Deferred; may require physician clearance to return</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Key point:</strong> The threshold is 99.5°F. A reading of 99.4°F is acceptable; 99.5°F and above triggers automatic deferral. Some centers use strict digital thermometry, while others use calibrated forehead or ear thermometers, which may have ±0.3°F variance.</p>

<h3>How Temperature is Measured</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oral thermometer (most accurate):</strong> Placed under the tongue for 30-60 seconds. This is the gold standard.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal artery (forehead) thermometer:</strong> Non-invasive infrared measurement. May read slightly higher (±0.5°F) than oral.</li>
<li><strong>Ear thermometer:</strong> Tympanum measurement. Prone to user error but fast.</li>
<li><strong>Center standard:</strong> Most centers use calibrated digital oral thermometers for consistency.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your initial reading is 99.5°F or above, centers typically take a second reading. If both readings are at or above 99.5°F, you are deferred. If the second reading is below 99.5°F, some centers may allow donation, but policies vary.</p>

<h2 id="why-fever-disqualifies">Why Fevers Disqualify Donors from Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Temperature screening is not arbitrary. A fever indicates active immune response, which affects plasma composition and recipient safety.</p>

<h3>Physiological Reasons for Fever-Related Deferral</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infection indication:</strong> A fever almost always means your body is fighting an infection (viral, bacterial, or sometimes fungal). Donating plasma while infected risks transmitting pathogens to immunocompromised recipients.</li>
<li><strong>Altered immune globulin levels:</strong> During fever, your body rapidly produces immunoglobulins (antibodies) to fight infection. This changes the protein composition of your plasma, which may not be suitable for recipients with specific deficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Inflammatory markers:</strong> Fever involves elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, etc.). These are not directly harmful in donated plasma, but high levels indicate acute illness that may affect plasma quality.</li>
<li><strong>Blood volume shifts:</strong> Fever causes dehydration and fluid shifts. Your plasma may be more concentrated than normal, affecting donation suitability.</li>
<li><strong>Medication interactions:</strong> Fever often prompts fever-reducing medications (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), which can affect platelet function and plasma clotting factors.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown infection risk:</strong> Even if your fever is mild, you may be in the early stages of a serious infection that blood/plasma testing cannot yet detect (window period).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipient Safety Concerns</h3>
<p>Plasma recipients are often severely immunocompromised (burn victims, trauma patients, immunodeficiency patients, premature infants). Plasma from a febrile donor could expose them to pathogens their immune system cannot fight. The FDA and plasma manufacturers prioritize recipient safety over donor convenience.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-wait">How Long to Wait After Fever Breaks</h2>

<p>Once your fever resolves, when can you safely donate? The timeline depends on the underlying cause and your center's specific policy.</p>

<h3>Standard Waiting Periods After Fever Resolution</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Fever Cause</th><th>Typical Duration</th><th>Waiting Period After Last Fever</th><th>Additional Conditions</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Common cold (viral)</td><td>3-7 days</td><td>24–48 hours</td><td>All symptoms must be resolved</td></tr>
<tr><td>Influenza</td><td>3-7 days</td><td>48–72 hours</td><td>No cough, fatigue, or body aches</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sinus infection (bacterial)</td><td>7–14 days</td><td>48–72 hours after antibiotics started</td><td>Usually on amoxicillin or similar</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strep throat</td><td>3–7 days</td><td>24–48 hours after starting antibiotics</td><td>Fever-free for entire period</td></tr>
<tr><td>Urinary tract infection</td><td>3–7 days</td><td>24–48 hours after antibiotics</td><td>Symptoms must resolve</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID-19 (mild)</td><td>5–10 days</td><td>48–72 hours after fever breaks</td><td>Must be symptom-free; avoid if severe</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unidentified fever</td><td>Unclear</td><td>72 hours + physician clearance</td><td>Center physician may require exam</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> "Fever-free" means at least 24-48 hours without any fever, even if you did not take fever-reducing medication. If you took ibuprofen and your temperature dropped to 98°F, you are not truly fever-free — the fever is suppressed. You must be naturally fever-free without medication assistance.</p>

<h3>Example Timeline: Viral Infection</h3>
<p>Day 1: Temperature spikes to 101°F. You are deferred. Day 2: Fever continues at 100.5°F. Still deferred. Day 3: Fever breaks; temperature is 98.6°F. You are now fever-free, but most centers want you to wait 24-48 more hours to confirm the fever does not return. Day 4-5: You can likely donate (depending on whether other symptoms remain).</p>

<h2 id="infection-risk">Infection Risk and Donor Safety Protocols</h2>

<p>Fever is a sign of infection, and infection is one of the leading reasons for plasma donor deferral. Understanding the infection risk helps explain why temperature screening is so strict.</p>

<h3>Pathogen Detection Window Period</h3>
<p>Plasma centers screen for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and other pathogens using sensitive tests. However, there is a "window period" — a time after infection but before tests can detect it when you can still transmit the pathogen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HIV:</strong> Window period is 9-33 days (up to 45 days for some newer infections) depending on the test used.</li>
<li><strong>Hepatitis B:</strong> Window period is 45-60 days.</li>
<li><strong>Hepatitis C:</strong> Window period is 15-45 days.</li>
<li><strong>Syphilis:</strong> Window period is 3-90 days depending on infection stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>A fever during this window period is often the earliest sign of infection. By deferring febrile donors, centers reduce the risk of transmitting pathogens to recipients despite negative test results.</p>

<h3>Why Fever Matters More Than Other Symptoms</h3>
<p>A fever is a systemic sign of infection. You can have bacterial sinus infection, strep throat, or UTI without fever, and still donate after finishing antibiotics. But if you have fever, it means acute infection is present, and deferral is safer for recipients.</p>

<h2 id="borderline-temps">Borderline Temperature Strategies</h2>

<p>What if your temperature is 99.4°F — just below the cutoff? Or you have a reading right at 99.5°F? Here are practical strategies and what to expect.</p>

<h3>If Your Temperature is 99.0–99.4°F</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask for retesting:</strong> Request a second reading. Some centers will accept a below-cutoff retest.</li>
<li><strong>Check thermometer accuracy:</strong> Ask if the center's thermometer has been recently calibrated. Forehead/ear thermometers may read 0.3–0.5°F higher than oral.</li>
<li><strong>Take oral reading instead:</strong> If the center used a forehead thermometer and you are borderline, ask for an oral thermometer for greater accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Wait 30 minutes and retake:</strong> If you just came from a car, exercised, or drank hot beverage, your temperature may be temporarily elevated. Sitting in the cool waiting room for 30 minutes might lower it by 0.3–0.5°F.</li>
<li><strong>Know center policy:</strong> Some centers have discretion in the 99.0–99.4°F range; others defer automatically. Ask your center's specific cutoff policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If Your Temperature is Exactly 99.5°F</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>You will likely be deferred.</strong> The cutoff is 99.5°F and above, so even 99.5°F triggers automatic deferral at most centers.</li>
<li><strong>Request a retest immediately.</strong> If the second reading is 99.4°F, some centers may honor the lower reading and allow donation.</li>
<li><strong>Understand this is for safety.</strong> The margin is small, but even a 0.1°F difference matters in medical settings. Do not argue with screening staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre-Donation Temperature Management</h3>
<p>To optimize your temperature on donation day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid strenuous exercise for 2-3 hours before donation.</li>
<li>Do not drink hot beverages immediately before screening.</li>
<li>Arrive cool (not overheated from warm car).</li>
<li>Sit in the cool waiting room for 10-15 minutes before screening if you feel warm.</li>
<li>Avoid coming to donation if you feel feverish — you will be deferred anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="monitoring">Temperature Monitoring and Preparation</h2>

<p>If you have been recently ill and want to return to donation, proper temperature monitoring ensures you meet eligibility requirements.</p>

<h3>How to Accurately Check Your Temperature at Home</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Accuracy</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Oral digital thermometer</td><td>±0.2°F</td><td>Most accurate, inexpensive</td><td>Requires 30-60 sec wait</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rectal thermometer</td><td>±0.1°F</td><td>Most accurate overall</td><td>Inconvenient, not suitable for adults</td></tr>
<tr><td>Temporal artery (forehead)</td><td>±0.5°F</td><td>Fast, non-invasive</td><td>Less accurate; affected by sweating</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ear (tympanum) thermometer</td><td>±0.5°F</td><td>Fast</td><td>Prone to user error; cerumen interference</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For donation eligibility, use an oral thermometer to match center screening method. If your home temperature is below 99.5°F and you have been symptom-free for 24-48 hours, you likely meet the temperature requirement.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Is 99.4°F too high to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>No. The FDA cutoff is 99.5°F. A temperature of 99.4°F is acceptable. However, some centers may have their own policies. Always confirm with your center.</p>

<h3>How long after a fever breaks can I donate?</h3>
<p>Most centers require 24-48 hours of being fever-free (without fever-reducing medications) after the fever breaks before you can donate. If you had a bacterial infection with antibiotics, wait until you have been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours and are symptom-free.</p>

<h3>Can I take fever-reducing medicine before screening to lower my temperature?</h3>
<p>No. This is not recommended. If your fever is real enough that you need medication to hide it, you likely should not be donating. Fever-reducing drugs also affect plasma composition. Be honest about your health status.</p>

<h3>Does a fever during donation affect the plasma quality?</h3>
<p>Yes. Fever indicates immune activation, which alters immunoglobulin levels and other plasma proteins. This changes the composition of your plasma, making it unsuitable for many clinical uses.</p>

<h3>What if my temperature is exactly 99.5°F?</h3>
<p>You will be deferred. 99.5°F is at the cutoff threshold and triggers deferral. Request a second reading — if it comes back at 99.4°F, some centers may allow donation, but many will not make exceptions.</p>
