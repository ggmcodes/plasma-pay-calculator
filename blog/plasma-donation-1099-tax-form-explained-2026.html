<h3>Quick Answer</h3>
<p><strong>Plasma centers issue a 1099-NEC (not 1099-MISC) if you earn $600 or more from a single center in a calendar year.</strong> Even if you earn less than $600 and do NOT receive a 1099, you are still legally required to report the income on your tax return. Plasma income is reported on <strong>Schedule 1, Line 8z</strong> as "Other Income" and is <strong>NOT subject to self-employment tax</strong> &mdash; saving you 15.3% compared to gig work or freelancing.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="1099-nec-basics">Understanding the 1099-NEC for Plasma Donation</h2>
<p>Since 2020, non-employee compensation is reported on Form <strong>1099-NEC</strong> (Nonemployee Compensation), not the older 1099-MISC. Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h3>Key Facts About the 1099-NEC</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form type:</strong> 1099-NEC (replaced 1099-MISC Box 7 for nonemployee compensation)</li>
<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> Centers must issue one if they paid you <strong>$600 or more</strong> during the tax year</li>
<li><strong>Mailing deadline:</strong> Centers must send it by <strong>January 31</strong> for the prior tax year</li>
<li><strong>Your copy:</strong> You receive Copy B for your records</li>
<li><strong>IRS copy:</strong> The center also files a copy with the IRS (they know about it)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the 1099-NEC Looks Like</h3>

<tbody>
<tr><td>Payer Name</td><td>The plasma center's legal name</td><td>e.g., "CSL Plasma Inc."</td></tr>

<tr><td>Recipient Name</td><td>Your legal name</td><td>Your name</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recipient TIN</td><td>Your SSN (partially masked)</td><td>XXX-XX-1234</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Box 1</strong></td><td><strong>Nonemployee Compensation</strong></td><td><strong>$2,400.00</strong> (example)</td></tr>

<h2 id="when-issued">When Do You Get a 1099 from a Plasma Center?</h2>

<h3>You WILL Receive a 1099-NEC If:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You earned <strong>$600 or more</strong> from a single plasma center in one calendar year</li>
<li>Donating twice weekly at $50-$75/visit, you will hit $600 in about <strong>4-6 weeks</strong></li>
<li>Most regular donors will receive a 1099-NEC from every center they visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>You Will NOT Receive a 1099-NEC If:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You earned <strong>less than $600</strong> from a particular center in one year</li>
<li>You donated only a few times before stopping</li>
<li>You split time between multiple centers, earning under $600 at each</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important: No 1099 Does NOT Mean No Tax</h3>
<p><strong>You must report ALL plasma income on your tax return, even without a 1099.</strong> The $600 threshold only determines whether the center must issue a form &mdash; it has nothing to do with whether the income is taxable. All plasma income is taxable regardless of amount.</p>

<h2 id="multi-center">The Multi-Center Strategy &mdash; Tax Implications</h2>
<p>Some donors split donations between multiple centers to take advantage of new donor bonuses. Here is how this affects your 1099 situation:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Strategy</th><th>1099s Received</th><th>Tax Reporting</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>One center all year ($4,800)</td><td>1 form (showing $4,800)</td><td>Report $4,800 on Schedule 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two centers ($2,400 each)</td><td>2 forms ($2,400 each)</td><td>Report $4,800 total on Schedule 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two centers ($500 each)</td><td>0 forms (under $600 each)</td><td>Still report $1,000 on Schedule 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Four centers ($500 each)</td><td>0 forms (under $600 each)</td><td>Still report $2,000 on Schedule 1</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Splitting centers does NOT reduce your tax obligation. The IRS expects you to report all income regardless of whether you receive a 1099. Deliberately splitting centers to avoid 1099s is not a legitimate tax strategy and could trigger an audit if the IRS receives conflicting information.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-report">How to Report Plasma Income on Your Tax Return</h2>
<p>Plasma donation income is reported as <strong>"Other Income"</strong> on your federal tax return. Here is the path:</p>

<h3>Tax Form Sequence</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Form 1040</strong> (your main return) &rarr; Line 8 references Schedule 1</li>
<li><strong>Schedule 1</strong> (Additional Income and Adjustments) &rarr; <strong>Part I, Line 8z</strong> (Other Income)</li>
<li>Write <strong>"Plasma donation income"</strong> as the description</li>
<li>Enter the total amount from all centers combined</li>
<li>This amount flows back to Form 1040, Line 8</li>
</ol>

<h3>What About State Taxes?</h3>
<p>Most states follow the federal treatment &mdash; plasma income is taxable on your state return as well. States with no income tax (Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, etc.) do not apply. For other states, the income flows through to your state return automatically when you report it on your federal return.</p>

<h2 id="not-self-employment">Why Plasma Income is NOT Self-Employment Income</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important tax distinctions for plasma donors. Plasma compensation is <strong>not self-employment income</strong>, which saves you a significant amount of money.</p>

<h3>The Key Difference</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Self-Employment Income (Schedule C)</th><th>Plasma "Other Income" (Schedule 1)</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Tax form</td><td>Schedule C + Schedule SE</td><td>Schedule 1, Line 8z only</td></tr>
<tr><td>Self-employment tax (15.3%)</td><td>YES &mdash; you pay it</td><td><strong>NO &mdash; you do NOT pay it</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>Federal income tax</td><td>Yes, at your bracket rate</td><td>Yes, at your bracket rate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deduct expenses</td><td>Yes (mileage, etc.)</td><td>No (no Schedule C)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Example: $5,000 income at 12% bracket</td><td>$600 income tax + $765 SE tax = <strong>$1,365</strong></td><td>$600 income tax + $0 SE tax = <strong>$600</strong></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>You save $765 on $5,000 of plasma income</strong> by correctly reporting it as Other Income instead of self-employment. The IRS has clarified that selling bodily fluids/tissue is not a "trade or business" &mdash; it is compensation for a personal activity.</p>

<h3>What About Mileage Deductions?</h3>
<p>Since plasma income is not reported on Schedule C, you cannot deduct mileage, travel, or other expenses against it. However, the self-employment tax savings (15.3%) almost always far outweigh any potential mileage deduction. For most donors, the math strongly favors the "Other Income" classification.</p>

<h2 id="tax-walkthrough">Sample Tax Form Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Here is a step-by-step example for a donor who earned $4,800 from plasma in 2025 (filing in early 2026):</p>

<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>1099-NEC from CSL Plasma showing $4,800 in Box 1</li>
<li>Any other W-2s or income documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Complete Schedule 1, Part I</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Description</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Line 8z</td><td>Other income &mdash; type: <em>Plasma donation income</em></td><td>$4,800</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line 10</td><td>Total other income (sum of 8a-8z)</td><td>$4,800</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Step 3: Transfer to Form 1040</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Description</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Line 8</td><td>Other income (from Schedule 1, line 10)</td><td>$4,800</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line 9</td><td>Total income (wages + other income)</td><td>Your total</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Step 4: Calculate Your Tax</h3>
<p>At the <strong>12% tax bracket</strong>, your federal tax on $4,800 of plasma income is approximately <strong>$576</strong>. If you were in the 10% bracket, it would be $480. Remember: no self-employment tax applies.</p>

<h3>Using Tax Software</h3>
<p>In TurboTax, H&R Block, or FreeTaxUSA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>"Other Income"</strong> or <strong>"1099-NEC"</strong> section</li>
<li>Enter the 1099-NEC information</li>
<li>When asked if this is self-employment income, select <strong>"No"</strong></li>
<li>The software will route it to Schedule 1, Line 8z automatically</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do plasma centers send you a 1099?</h3>
<p>Yes, if you earn $600 or more from a single center in one calendar year, they are required to send you a 1099-NEC by January 31. If you earn less than $600 at a center, they are not required to send one, but the income is still taxable.</p>

<h3>Is a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC used for plasma income?</h3>
<p>Since 2020, plasma centers use the <strong>1099-NEC</strong> (Nonemployee Compensation), not the 1099-MISC. If you receive a 1099-MISC for plasma income, contact the center to request a corrected form.</p>

<h3>Do I have to pay self-employment tax on plasma income?</h3>
<p>No. Plasma donation income is classified as "Other Income" and reported on Schedule 1, Line 8z. It is NOT self-employment income, so you do NOT pay the 15.3% self-employment tax (Social Security + Medicare). This saves you approximately $765 per $5,000 earned.</p>

<h3>What if I donated at multiple centers and got multiple 1099s?</h3>
<p>Add up the amounts from all 1099-NEC forms and report the total on Schedule 1, Line 8z as a single "Plasma donation income" entry. You do not need to list each center separately on your return, though you should keep all 1099s for your records.</p>

<h3>What happens if I don't report plasma income?</h3>
<p>If a center issued a 1099-NEC to the IRS and you don't report the income, the IRS will likely send you a CP2000 notice proposing additional tax. They may also classify it as self-employment income (which costs more in taxes) and add penalties and interest. Always report all plasma income, even without a 1099.</p>
