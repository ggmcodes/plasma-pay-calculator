<h2 id="answer">Can You Donate Plasma With Food Poisoning?</h2>
<p><strong>No, wait until you're fully recovered</strong> in 2026:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active symptoms:</strong> Cannot donate</li>
<li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Dangerous with plasma removal</li>
<li><strong>Quick recovery:</strong> Usually 24-48 hours</li>
<li><strong>After resolved:</strong> Can donate once well</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms That Disqualify</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Symptom</th><th>Can Donate?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Vomiting</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Wait 24-48h after last episode</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Diarrhea</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Wait until normal bowel</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Nausea</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Too risky</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Stomach cramps</strong></td><td>WAIT</td><td>Until resolved</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Fever</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Auto-deferral</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Dehydration</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Must rehydrate first</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Why Food Poisoning Disqualifies</h2>
<p><strong>Multiple concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> GI illness depletes fluids - plasma removal dangerous</li>
<li><strong>Electrolyte imbalance:</strong> Vomiting/diarrhea disrupts electrolytes</li>
<li><strong>Feeling terrible:</strong> You won't tolerate donation well</li>
<li><strong>Contagious:</strong> Some causes can spread</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Dehydration Factor</h2>
<p><strong>Critical safety issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plasma = 90% water:</strong> Removing more fluid when dehydrated is dangerous</li>
<li><strong>Low blood volume:</strong> GI illness already depleted fluids</li>
<li><strong>Faint risk:</strong> Much higher when dehydrated</li>
<li><strong>Recovery time:</strong> Need time to rehydrate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recovery">Recovery Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>When can you donate?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mild food poisoning:</strong> 24-48 hours after symptoms stop</li>
<li><strong>Moderate case:</strong> 2-3 days after recovery</li>
<li><strong>Severe case:</strong> 3-5 days, focus on rehydration</li>
<li><strong>If hospitalized:</strong> Discuss with center</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tips">Returning After Food Poisoning</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wait for resolution:</strong> No more symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Rehydrate fully:</strong> Drink lots of fluids for 24-48h</li>
<li><strong>Eat normally:</strong> Appetite back, keeping food down</li>
<li><strong>Energy normal:</strong> Not still weak/tired</li>
<li><strong>Bowels normal:</strong> Regular function</li>
<li><strong>No fever:</strong> Temperature normal</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rehydration Before Donation</h2>
<p><strong>Getting ready to return:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Drink plenty</li>
<li><strong>Electrolytes:</strong> Sports drinks, Pedialyte</li>
<li><strong>Light food:</strong> Start with bland foods</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Give your body 24-48 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Causes</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Cause</th><th>Typical Duration</th><th>Wait After</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Norovirus</strong></td><td>1-3 days</td><td>24-48h after symptoms</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Bacterial (Salmonella, E. coli)</strong></td><td>3-7 days</td><td>Until fully recovered</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Bad seafood</strong></td><td>12-48 hours</td><td>24-48h after symptoms</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>General stomach bug</strong></td><td>1-3 days</td><td>24-48h after symptoms</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Antibiotics for GI Illness</h2>
<p><strong>If prescribed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finish course:</strong> Complete all antibiotics</li>
<li><strong>Then wait:</strong> 24-48 hours after last dose</li>
<li><strong>Feel well:</strong> Symptoms fully resolved</li>
<li><strong>Most don't need:</strong> Most food poisoning is viral</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>I had food poisoning yesterday but feel OK today - can I donate?</h3>
<p>It's best to wait at least 24-48 hours after your last symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, nausea) before donating. Even if you feel "OK," your body is likely still dehydrated and recovering. Focus on rehydrating today and donate tomorrow or the next day.</p>

<h3>I only vomited once - do I really need to wait?</h3>
<p>If it was truly a one-time vomiting episode and you feel completely fine (no nausea, no diarrhea, eating and drinking normally), you might be OK. However, if there's any chance you'll feel sick during donation, it's better to wait. Vomiting at a plasma center is not fun for anyone.</p>

<h3>I have diarrhea but no other symptoms - can I donate?</h3>
<p>No, active diarrhea is a deferral. Diarrhea causes dehydration and electrolyte loss, which makes plasma donation risky. Wait until your bowel movements are back to normal for at least 24 hours before donating.</p>

<h3>How do I know if I'm hydrated enough after food poisoning?</h3>
<p>Good signs you're rehydrated: your urine is light yellow (not dark), you're not thirsty, you feel energetic, and you've been keeping fluids down for 24+ hours. If you're still feeling weak, tired, or thirsty, give yourself more time to recover.</p>

<h3>I get food poisoning a lot - will this affect my ability to donate regularly?</h3>
<p>Frequent GI illness is a health concern worth discussing with a doctor, but each episode only temporarily defers you. As long as you recover fully between episodes, you can donate. However, consider food safety practices if you're getting sick often.</p>
