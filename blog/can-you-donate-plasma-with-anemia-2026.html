<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>You can donate plasma with mild anemia if your hemoglobin is at least 12.5 g/dL (women) or 13.0 g/dL (men). Moderate to severe anemia will disqualify you. If you're borderline, iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate 325mg daily) plus iron-rich foods like red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals can raise levels to passing range within 1-2 weeks.</p></div>

<p>Anemia and low iron are among the most common reasons plasma donors get turned away at screening. The finger prick test takes seconds, but failing it means no donation and no payment that day. If you're concerned about your iron levels or have been deferred before, this guide explains exactly what centers require, which types of anemia affect eligibility, and proven strategies to boost your hemoglobin fast.</p>

<p>Understanding the relationship between iron, hemoglobin, and plasma donation is essential for consistent eligibility. Regular plasma donors face unique challenges because frequent donations gradually deplete iron stores, even if you're eating well. The good news is that strategic supplementation and dietary changes work quickly for most people.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Requirements by Center</h2>

<p>Plasma centers measure two key values before every donation: hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells) and hematocrit (the percentage of blood volume made up of red blood cells). Both must meet minimum thresholds.</p>

<h3>Standard Requirements</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>Women Hemoglobin</th><th>Men Hemoglobin</th><th>Hematocrit (Both)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CSL Plasma</td><td>12.5 g/dL</td><td>13.0 g/dL</td><td>38%</td></tr>
<tr><td>BioLife</td><td>12.5 g/dL</td><td>13.0 g/dL</td><td>38%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grifols (Biomat)</td><td>12.5 g/dL</td><td>13.0 g/dL</td><td>38%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octapharma</td><td>12.0 g/dL</td><td>13.0 g/dL</td><td>38%</td></tr>
<tr><td>KEDPLASMA</td><td>12.5 g/dL</td><td>13.0 g/dL</td><td>38%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Most centers use 12.5 g/dL for women and 13.0 g/dL for men as the cutoff. A few centers accept 12.0 g/dL for women. These requirements are lower than whole blood donation (12.5 for women, 13.0 for men at Red Cross), but they're still high enough to screen out moderate anemia.</p>

<h3>What the Numbers Mean</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hemoglobin (Hb):</strong> Measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL). Normal range is 12.0-16.0 for women, 13.5-17.5 for men. Below 12.0 is considered anemic for women, below 13.0 for men.</li>
<li><strong>Hematocrit (Hct):</strong> Percentage of blood that's red blood cells. Normal range is 36-44% for women, 40-50% for men. Below 36% is typically anemic.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Hemoglobin and hematocrit track closely. Roughly, hematocrit is about 3x hemoglobin (12.5 g/dL hemoglobin = approximately 37.5% hematocrit).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're right at the threshold, small daily fluctuations in hydration status can affect results. Being well-hydrated actually dilutes your blood slightly, potentially lowering measured hemoglobin. Dehydration concentrates blood, raising measured levels. This is why consistent hydration matters for consistent screening results.</p>

<h2 id="screening">How Plasma Center Screening Works</h2>

<p>Every donation visit begins with a finger prick test. Here's the exact process:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Finger prick:</strong> Technician cleans your finger and uses a small lancet to draw a drop of blood</li>
<li><strong>Sample collection:</strong> Blood goes into a small tube or is tested immediately</li>
<li><strong>Automated analysis:</strong> Machine measures hemoglobin and hematocrit in 30-60 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Pass/fail decision:</strong> If you're above threshold, you proceed. Below, you're deferred.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why Finger Prick Instead of Venous Blood</h3>
<p>Finger prick (capillary) blood sometimes reads slightly different from venous blood drawn from your arm. Capillary samples can be 0.2-0.5 g/dL higher or lower depending on circulation, temperature, and technique. This is why borderline results can vary between visits even when your true levels haven't changed much.</p>

<h3>Immediate Results</h3>
<p>Unlike doctor's office blood tests that take days, plasma centers give instant feedback. You'll know within a minute whether you're approved. If you fail, the staff will tell you your exact numbers and when you can try again (usually 1-2 weeks, sometimes longer for very low results).</p>

<h2 id="types-anemia">Types of Anemia and How Each Affects Eligibility</h2>

<p>Not all anemia is the same. The type and severity determine whether you can donate and how quickly you can raise levels.</p>

<h3>Iron-Deficiency Anemia (Most Common)</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Insufficient iron for hemoglobin production. Accounts for 50% of all anemia cases and is extremely common in frequent plasma donors.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> You can donate if hemoglobin is above threshold, but progressive iron depletion means you'll eventually fall below cutoff without supplementation.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Iron supplements (ferrous sulfate 325mg daily) plus iron-rich foods. Most responsive to intervention with results in 1-2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Why donors get it:</strong> Each plasma donation removes about 0.5mg of iron. Donating twice weekly (recommended maximum) removes about 52mg of iron per month. Adult men only absorb about 1mg of dietary iron daily; women absorb slightly more but lose iron through menstruation. Diet alone often can't keep up.</p>

<h3>Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Lack of vitamin B12 needed for red blood cell production. Common in vegetarians/vegans and people with absorption issues.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Can donate if hemoglobin meets requirements. B12 deficiency develops slowly, so you may pass screening for a while before levels drop.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> B12 supplements (1000mcg daily sublingual) or injections. Dietary sources include meat, fish, eggs, and fortified foods. Takes 4-8 weeks to see significant improvement.</p>

<h3>Folate (Folic Acid) Deficiency Anemia</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Insufficient folate for red blood cell production. Less common in U.S. due to fortified grains.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Same as B12 deficiency - depends on hemoglobin level.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Folic acid supplements (400-800mcg daily). Dietary sources include leafy greens, beans, fortified cereals. Responds faster than B12 deficiency, usually 2-4 weeks.</p>

<h3>Anemia of Chronic Disease</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Chronic inflammation from conditions like kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, or chronic infections.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Depends on hemoglobin level and the underlying condition. Some chronic diseases disqualify you from plasma donation regardless of hemoglobin. Check with center medical staff.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treat underlying condition. Iron supplements may not help significantly because the issue is inflammation, not iron deficiency.</p>

<h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Red blood cells destroyed faster than they're produced. Can be genetic (sickle cell, thalassemia) or acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Most hemolytic anemias disqualify you from donation. These are considered chronic conditions that make donation unsafe.</p>

<h3>Aplastic Anemia</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Bone marrow doesn't produce enough blood cells.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Disqualifies from plasma donation. This is a serious condition requiring medical treatment.</p>

<h2 id="iron-foods">Iron-Rich Foods: Complete Guide for Plasma Donors</h2>

<p>Diet is your first line of defense against iron depletion. Regular plasma donors should prioritize iron-rich foods every day, not just before donation.</p>

<h3>Best Iron Sources (Heme Iron - Most Absorbable)</h3>
<p>Heme iron from animal sources is absorbed at 15-35% efficiency, much higher than plant-based non-heme iron (2-20%).</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Food</th><th>Serving Size</th><th>Iron Content</th><th>% Daily Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Beef liver</td><td>3 oz (85g)</td><td>5.0 mg</td><td>28%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oysters</td><td>3 oz (6 medium)</td><td>8.0 mg</td><td>44%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beef (chuck roast)</td><td>3 oz</td><td>3.2 mg</td><td>18%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chicken liver</td><td>3 oz</td><td>11.0 mg</td><td>61%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sardines (canned)</td><td>3 oz</td><td>2.5 mg</td><td>14%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ground beef (85% lean)</td><td>3 oz</td><td>2.2 mg</td><td>12%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Turkey (dark meat)</td><td>3 oz</td><td>2.0 mg</td><td>11%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Plant-Based Iron Sources (Non-Heme Iron)</h3>
<p>Non-heme iron is less efficiently absorbed but still valuable, especially when combined with vitamin C.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Food</th><th>Serving Size</th><th>Iron Content</th><th>% Daily Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Fortified breakfast cereal</td><td>1 cup</td><td>18.0 mg</td><td>100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>White beans (canned)</td><td>1 cup</td><td>8.0 mg</td><td>44%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lentils (cooked)</td><td>1 cup</td><td>6.6 mg</td><td>37%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spinach (cooked)</td><td>1 cup</td><td>6.4 mg</td><td>36%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kidney beans (cooked)</td><td>1 cup</td><td>5.2 mg</td><td>29%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chickpeas (cooked)</td><td>1 cup</td><td>4.7 mg</td><td>26%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dark chocolate (70-85%)</td><td>1 oz (28g)</td><td>3.4 mg</td><td>19%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tofu (firm)</td><td>1/2 cup</td><td>3.4 mg</td><td>19%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blackstrap molasses</td><td>1 tablespoon</td><td>3.5 mg</td><td>20%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Vitamin C Enhancers (Boost Iron Absorption by 30%)</h3>
<p>Always pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources to maximize absorption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orange juice (1 cup = 124mg vitamin C)</li>
<li>Strawberries (1 cup = 89mg)</li>
<li>Bell peppers (1 medium = 152mg)</li>
<li>Broccoli (1 cup cooked = 101mg)</li>
<li>Tomatoes (1 medium = 17mg)</li>
<li>Kiwi (1 medium = 64mg)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Foods That Block Iron Absorption (Avoid Near Iron Sources)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee and tea:</strong> Tannins reduce absorption by up to 60%. Wait 1-2 hours after iron-rich meals.</li>
<li><strong>Dairy products:</strong> Calcium competes with iron absorption. Separate by 2+ hours.</li>
<li><strong>Whole grains:</strong> Phytates in bran can reduce absorption. Still healthy overall, just don't rely on them as iron sources.</li>
<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Contain phosvitin, which inhibits iron absorption. Don't count on eggs for iron despite containing some.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Daily Meal Plan for Iron Boosting</h3>
<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Fortified cereal with strawberries, glass of orange juice (21mg iron, 213mg vitamin C)</p>
<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Spinach salad with grilled chicken, bell peppers, lemon vinaigrette (9mg iron, 170mg vitamin C)</p>
<p><strong>Snack:</strong> Dark chocolate square with orange slices (4mg iron, 70mg vitamin C)</p>
<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Beef stir-fry with broccoli and tomatoes over rice (8mg iron, 135mg vitamin C)</p>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> 42mg iron (233% DV), 588mg vitamin C - far exceeding daily needs and compensating for frequent donation losses.</p>

<h2 id="supplements">Iron Supplements: Types, Dosage, and Timing</h2>

<p>For frequent plasma donors, diet alone often isn't enough. Iron supplementation is the fastest, most reliable way to maintain qualifying hemoglobin levels.</p>

<h3>Best Iron Supplements for Donors</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Elemental Iron</th><th>Absorption</th><th>Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Ferrous sulfate 325mg</td><td>65mg</td><td>High</td><td>$</td><td>Most recommended, best value</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ferrous gluconate 325mg</td><td>36mg</td><td>Moderate</td><td>$$</td><td>Gentler on stomach</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ferrous fumarate 325mg</td><td>106mg</td><td>High</td><td>$$</td><td>Highest elemental iron</td></tr>
<tr><td>Iron bisglycinate</td><td>25-28mg</td><td>High</td><td>$$$</td><td>Chelated, minimal side effects</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carbonyl iron</td><td>45-50mg</td><td>Moderate</td><td>$$</td><td>Safer for accidental overdose</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Recommended Dosage for Plasma Donors</h3>
<p><strong>Standard protocol:</strong> Ferrous sulfate 325mg (65mg elemental iron) once daily</p>
<p><strong>Aggressive repletion:</strong> 325mg twice daily for 1-2 weeks if significantly low, then reduce to once daily</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> 325mg every other day if donating infrequently or levels are stable</p>

<p>Do not exceed 45mg elemental iron daily without medical supervision. More isn't always better - excess iron can cause toxicity and isn't absorbed efficiently anyway.</p>

<h3>Optimal Timing for Maximum Absorption</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best time:</strong> On an empty stomach, 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after</li>
<li><strong>With vitamin C:</strong> Take with orange juice, vitamin C tablet (500-1000mg), or vitamin C gummy</li>
<li><strong>Avoid taking with:</strong> Coffee, tea, dairy, calcium supplements, antacids, or other medications (separate by 2+ hours)</li>
<li><strong>Consistency matters:</strong> Take at the same time daily for best results</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Side Effects</h3>
<p>Iron supplements commonly cause:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constipation:</strong> Increase water intake, add fiber, consider stool softener</li>
<li><strong>Stomach upset:</strong> Take with small amount of food if necessary (reduces absorption slightly but better than skipping)</li>
<li><strong>Nausea:</strong> Try taking before bed, or switch to gentler form like ferrous gluconate or iron bisglycinate</li>
<li><strong>Dark stools:</strong> Normal and harmless, indicates iron is passing through digestive system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expected Timeline for Results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Minor improvements, may not be measurable yet</li>
<li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Noticeable increase in hemoglobin (typically 0.5-1.0 g/dL)</li>
<li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Significant improvement (1.0-2.0 g/dL increase possible)</li>
<li><strong>Week 8-12:</strong> Full repletion of iron stores for most people</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're borderline (0.2-0.5 g/dL below cutoff), aggressive supplementation for 7-10 days can often get you back to qualifying range.</p>

<h2 id="frequent-donation">How Frequent Plasma Donation Causes Iron Depletion</h2>

<p>Even if you start with perfect iron levels, frequent plasma donation progressively depletes your stores. Understanding the mechanism helps you prevent future deferrals.</p>

<h3>The Iron Loss Cycle</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Each donation removes iron:</strong> About 0.5mg per session in hemoglobin lost during the donation process</li>
<li><strong>Twice-weekly donation:</strong> Approximately 4mg iron lost per month (52mg per year)</li>
<li><strong>Dietary absorption limits:</strong> Adult men absorb approximately 1mg iron daily from food; women 1.0-1.5mg</li>
<li><strong>The math doesn't work:</strong> Losing 52mg/year while absorbing only 365-548mg/year leaves little margin</li>
<li><strong>Iron stores deplete first:</strong> Your body uses stored iron (ferritin) to maintain hemoglobin. Ferritin drops long before hemoglobin.</li>
<li><strong>Hemoglobin eventually drops:</strong> Once stores are exhausted, hemoglobin begins falling below screening thresholds</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why Women Are More Vulnerable</h3>
<p>Women face higher iron depletion risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menstrual losses average 0.5-1.0mg iron daily (15-30mg per month)</li>
<li>Combined with donation losses, total can reach 6-8mg monthly</li>
<li>Higher baseline iron requirements (18mg daily vs 8mg for men)</li>
<li>Lower average body weight often means smaller iron reserves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progressive Depletion Stages</h3>
<p><strong>Stage 1 - Storage depletion (0-6 months frequent donation):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ferritin (stored iron) drops below normal (12-30 ng/mL)</li>
<li>Hemoglobin still normal, passing all screenings</li>
<li>No symptoms yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stage 2 - Early deficiency (6-12 months):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ferritin very low (below 12 ng/mL)</li>
<li>Hemoglobin starting to drop, may be borderline</li>
<li>Mild fatigue, occasional screening failures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stage 3 - Iron deficiency anemia (12+ months):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ferritin depleted (below 10 ng/mL)</li>
<li>Hemoglobin below screening threshold</li>
<li>Consistent screening failures, fatigue, weakness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prevention for Long-Term Donors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supplement proactively:</strong> Don't wait until you fail screening. Start iron supplements when you begin regular donation.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor ferritin:</strong> Ask your doctor to check ferritin annually. Levels below 30 ng/mL indicate you should supplement even if hemoglobin is normal.</li>
<li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Consider donating once weekly instead of twice, or take 1-2 weeks off every few months.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize diet:</strong> High-iron foods daily, not just before donation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="warning-signs">Warning Signs Your Iron Is Too Low</h2>

<p>Don't wait for screening failure. These symptoms indicate developing iron deficiency:</p>

<h3>Early Warning Signs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unusual fatigue:</strong> Tiredness disproportionate to activity level</li>
<li><strong>Decreased exercise tolerance:</strong> Getting winded more easily during normal activities</li>
<li><strong>Pale skin:</strong> Especially noticeable in nail beds, inner eyelids, palms</li>
<li><strong>Frequent headaches:</strong> Especially in afternoon/evening</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty concentrating:</strong> Brain fog, memory issues</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moderate Deficiency Signs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cold hands and feet:</strong> Poor circulation due to reduced oxygen delivery</li>
<li><strong>Brittle nails:</strong> Breaking, peeling, or spoon-shaped nails</li>
<li><strong>Hair loss:</strong> More shedding than normal</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs:</strong> Uncomfortable sensations and urge to move legs, especially at night</li>
<li><strong>Rapid heartbeat:</strong> Heart working harder to deliver oxygen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Severe Deficiency Signs (Seek Medical Care)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severe weakness:</strong> Difficulty with daily activities</li>
<li><strong>Dizziness or lightheadedness:</strong> Especially when standing</li>
<li><strong>Chest pain:</strong> Heart strain from anemia</li>
<li><strong>Shortness of breath:</strong> At rest or with minimal exertion</li>
<li><strong>Pica:</strong> Craving non-food items like ice, dirt, or starch</li>
</ul>

<p>If you experience severe symptoms, stop donating and consult a doctor. These indicate significant anemia requiring medical evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="recovery">Recovery Timeline: When Can You Donate Again?</h2>

<p>If you've been deferred for low hemoglobin, here's the realistic timeline for returning to eligible status.</p>

<h3>Borderline Deferral (0.1-0.5 g/dL below threshold)</h3>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1-2 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start ferrous sulfate 325mg daily immediately</li>
<li>Take with vitamin C on empty stomach</li>
<li>Eat iron-rich foods at every meal</li>
<li>Ensure adequate protein (red blood cell production requires protein)</li>
<li>Stay well-hydrated (but not over-hydrated before next screening)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected increase:</strong> 0.5-1.0 g/dL in 10-14 days with aggressive approach</p>

<h3>Moderate Deferral (0.5-2.0 g/dL below threshold)</h3>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4-6 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ferrous sulfate 325mg twice daily for first 2 weeks, then once daily</li>
<li>See doctor to rule out other causes (B12 deficiency, chronic disease, etc.)</li>
<li>Consider reducing donation frequency permanently</li>
<li>Retest at 4 weeks; if still low, continue supplements and retest at 6 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected increase:</strong> 1.0-2.0 g/dL in 4 weeks, full recovery in 6-8 weeks</p>

<h3>Severe Deferral (2.0+ g/dL below threshold)</h3>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 8-12 weeks minimum</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medical evaluation required - this level suggests underlying condition</li>
<li>Prescription iron may be needed (higher dose than over-the-counter)</li>
<li>Investigate non-iron causes (B12, folate, chronic disease, bleeding)</li>
<li>Do not return to donation until fully recovered and doctor approves</li>
<li>Reconsider whether regular plasma donation is sustainable for your health</li>
</ul>

<h3>Return Visit Tips</h3>
<p>When you go back for screening after deferral:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time it right:</strong> Wait the full recommended time. Going too early risks another deferral and discouragement.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrate normally:</strong> Not excessively, as over-hydration can dilute hemoglobin readings.</li>
<li><strong>Take supplements:</strong> Continue iron supplementation even after passing screening.</li>
<li><strong>Morning visit:</strong> Hemoglobin can be slightly higher in morning for some people.</li>
<li><strong>Bring documentation:</strong> If your doctor tested your hemoglobin, bring results to show center staff.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have anemia?</h3>
<p>It depends on severity. You need hemoglobin of at least 12.5 g/dL (women) or 13.0 g/dL (men) to donate. Mild anemia may still pass screening if you're above these thresholds. Moderate to severe anemia will disqualify you until levels improve.</p>

<h3>What is the minimum hemoglobin level to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers require 12.5 g/dL for women and 13.0 g/dL for men. Some centers may accept 12.0 g/dL for women. The minimum hematocrit is typically 38% for both genders. These requirements vary slightly by center.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to raise hemoglobin for plasma donation?</h3>
<p>With iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate 325mg daily) and iron-rich foods, most people see improvements in 1-2 weeks. Significant increases may take 4-6 weeks. Taking iron with vitamin C increases absorption by up to 30%.</p>

<h3>What foods raise hemoglobin fast for plasma donors?</h3>
<p>Red meat (beef, lamb), organ meats (liver), shellfish (oysters, clams), dark leafy greens (spinach, kale), legumes (lentils, beans), fortified cereals, and blackstrap molasses. Pair with vitamin C sources like citrus fruits for better absorption.</p>

<h3>Does donating plasma cause anemia?</h3>
<p>Frequent plasma donation can deplete iron stores over time, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. Each donation removes about 0.5mg of iron. Donating twice weekly can exceed your body's ability to replace iron through diet alone, requiring supplementation.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with iron-deficiency anemia?</h3>
<p>Only if your hemoglobin is above the center's threshold (12.5+ for women, 13.0+ for men). Early-stage iron deficiency with adequate hemoglobin may pass screening, but progressive iron loss will eventually lower hemoglobin below acceptable levels.</p>

<h3>What iron supplement is best for plasma donors?</h3>
<p>Ferrous sulfate 325mg (65mg elemental iron) taken daily is the most cost-effective. Take on an empty stomach with vitamin C for maximum absorption. Ferrous gluconate or ferrous fumarate are alternatives if sulfate causes stomach upset.</p>

<h3>How do plasma centers test for anemia?</h3>
<p>Centers use a finger prick blood test before each donation, measuring hemoglobin (protein carrying oxygen) and hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells). Results are immediate. If below threshold, you'll be deferred until levels improve.</p>
