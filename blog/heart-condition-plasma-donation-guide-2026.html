<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>Whether you can donate plasma with a heart condition depends entirely on the specific diagnosis. <strong>Heart murmurs, controlled high blood pressure, and mitral valve prolapse</strong> are usually accepted. <strong>Prior heart attack, heart failure, and prescription blood thinners</strong> are almost always disqualifying. Read the full condition-by-condition breakdown below to find your specific situation.</p></div>

<p>Millions of Americans live with some form of heart condition, from a benign heart murmur discovered in childhood to serious diagnoses like coronary artery disease. If you are one of them, you have probably wondered whether plasma donation is safe for you and whether centers will even accept you.</p>

<p>The answer is not a simple yes or no. Plasma centers evaluate heart conditions on a case-by-case basis, and different diagnoses lead to very different outcomes. Some conditions are routine and barely worth mentioning at your screening. Others are automatic, permanent deferrals no matter which center you visit.</p>

<p>This guide breaks down every major heart condition, explains whether it typically qualifies or disqualifies you, and tells you exactly what to expect at the screening process. We also cover which heart medications are allowed and which are not, because in many cases the medication you take matters more than the condition itself.</p>

<h2 id="condition-breakdown">Heart Conditions: Who Can Donate and Who Cannot</h2>

<p>Below is a summary table of the most common heart conditions and their typical eligibility status at major plasma centers like CSL Plasma, BioLife, Grifols, and Octapharma. Keep in mind that individual centers may have slightly different policies, and the final decision always rests with the center's medical staff.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Heart Condition</th><th>Typical Status</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Benign heart murmur</td><td>Usually Accepted</td><td>Doctor clearance may be needed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mitral valve prolapse</td><td>Usually Accepted</td><td>If asymptomatic, no significant regurgitation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Controlled hypertension</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Must be below 180/100 at screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arrhythmia / AFib</td><td>Depends</td><td>Varies by type, treatment, and stability</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prior heart attack</td><td>Permanent Deferral</td><td>Disqualifying at nearly all centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heart failure</td><td>Permanent Deferral</td><td>Any class of heart failure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coronary artery disease</td><td>Usually Disqualifying</td><td>Especially if stents, bypass, or ongoing symptoms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pacemaker / ICD</td><td>Varies by Center</td><td>Call ahead to check policy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Congenital heart defects</td><td>Case by Case</td><td>Depends on severity and repair status</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Now let us go through each condition in detail so you know exactly where you stand.</p>

<h2 id="heart-murmur">Heart Murmur</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With a Heart Murmur?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: Usually yes, if it has been diagnosed as benign or innocent.</strong></p>

<p>Heart murmurs are extremely common. They are simply unusual sounds that blood makes as it flows through the heart, and they are detected with a stethoscope during a physical exam. The key distinction is between two types:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Innocent (functional) murmurs:</strong> These are harmless and do not indicate any structural problem with the heart. They are found in up to 50% of children and many adults. If your doctor has told you that your murmur is innocent or benign, most plasma centers will accept you without issue.</li>
<li><strong>Pathological murmurs:</strong> These are caused by a structural problem such as a damaged or leaking valve. Whether you can donate depends on the underlying cause and its severity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What You Will Need</h3>

<p>If you disclose a heart murmur during screening, the center may ask you for:</p>

<ul>
<li>A letter from your doctor stating the murmur is benign</li>
<li>Documentation that you have been evaluated (echocardiogram results)</li>
<li>Confirmation that you have no symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or fainting</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Heart Murmur Tip</h3>
<p>If you know you have a heart murmur, get a doctor's clearance letter <em>before</em> your first visit. This saves you from being deferred on your first day and having to come back. A simple note stating "benign heart murmur, no activity restrictions" is usually sufficient.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="mitral-valve">Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With Mitral Valve Prolapse?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: Usually yes, especially if it is mild and asymptomatic.</strong></p>

<p>Mitral valve prolapse is one of the most common heart valve conditions, affecting roughly 2-3% of the population. In MVP, the mitral valve's leaflets bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium during the heart's contraction. Most people with MVP have no symptoms whatsoever and live completely normal lives.</p>

<p>Plasma centers generally accept donors with MVP under these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The MVP is asymptomatic (no chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath)</li>
<li>There is no significant mitral regurgitation (leaking of blood backward through the valve)</li>
<li>You are not taking blood thinners or other disqualifying medications for the condition</li>
<li>Your doctor has cleared you for normal physical activities</li>
</ul>

<p>If your MVP has progressed to the point where you have significant regurgitation, symptoms, or require medication, your eligibility becomes more uncertain. The center's physician will need to evaluate your specific case.</p>

<h2 id="hypertension">High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With High Blood Pressure?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: Yes, as long as your reading is below 180/100 at the time of donation.</strong></p>

<p>High blood pressure is one of the most common health conditions in the United States, affecting nearly half of all adults. The good news is that controlled hypertension does not disqualify you from donating plasma. What matters is your blood pressure reading at the screening station on the day you donate.</p>

<h3>Blood Pressure Thresholds</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Blood Pressure Reading</th><th>Status</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Under 140/90</td><td>Ideal</td><td>Accepted without concern</td></tr>
<tr><td>140/90 to 179/99</td><td>Elevated but Accepted</td><td>Staff may monitor more closely</td></tr>
<tr><td>180/100 or above</td><td>Deferred</td><td>Cannot donate that day; come back another time</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Tips for Managing Blood Pressure on Donation Day</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Take your medication:</strong> Do not skip your blood pressure medication on donation day. Some people worry that their medication will disqualify them, but most standard blood pressure medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics) are allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid caffeine beforehand:</strong> Coffee and energy drinks can temporarily spike your blood pressure. Skip them for a few hours before your appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Relax before screening:</strong> Sit quietly for five minutes before your blood pressure is taken. Rushing into the center from a stressful drive can give you a falsely elevated reading.</li>
<li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Dehydration can affect blood pressure readings. Drink plenty of water the day before and the morning of your donation.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid heavy meals right before:</strong> A large meal can temporarily affect your blood pressure and pulse readings.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Important Note on Blood Pressure Medications</h3>
<p>Most common blood pressure medications are accepted. However, if you are taking a blood thinner alongside your blood pressure medication (which is common in people with both hypertension and AFib), the blood thinner is what will disqualify you, not the blood pressure medication. See the <a href="#blood-thinners">blood thinners section</a> below.</p>

<h2 id="arrhythmia">Arrhythmia and Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With an Arrhythmia?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: It depends on the type, severity, and how it is being treated.</strong></p>

<p>Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats, and they range from completely benign to life-threatening. The plasma center's decision will depend heavily on the specifics of your condition.</p>

<h3>Types of Arrhythmia and Eligibility</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Occasional premature beats (PVCs, PACs):</strong> These are very common and usually benign. Most people experience them at some point. If your doctor has evaluated them and determined they are not clinically significant, you will likely be accepted. Your pulse at screening needs to be between 50 and 100 beats per minute and regular.</li>
<li><strong>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT):</strong> If your SVT is well-controlled or was corrected with an ablation procedure, some centers may accept you. You will likely need documentation from your cardiologist.</li>
<li><strong>Atrial fibrillation (AFib):</strong> This is where it gets complicated. AFib itself is a concern, but the bigger issue is often the medication used to manage it. Most people with AFib take blood thinners to prevent stroke, and those blood thinners are disqualifying. Even if your AFib is well-controlled, if you are taking Warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, or a similar anticoagulant, you cannot donate.</li>
<li><strong>Ventricular arrhythmias:</strong> Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are serious conditions that are almost always disqualifying, especially if they require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Pulse Check at Screening</h3>

<p>Every plasma donation visit includes a pulse check. Your pulse must fall within an acceptable range, typically between 50 and 100 beats per minute. If your arrhythmia causes your pulse to be outside this range or noticeably irregular at the time of screening, you will be deferred for that visit regardless of your underlying diagnosis.</p>

<h2 id="heart-attack">Prior Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma After a Heart Attack?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: No. A history of heart attack is a permanent deferral at most plasma centers.</strong></p>

<p>If you have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at any point in your life, you will almost certainly be permanently deferred from donating plasma. This applies regardless of how long ago the heart attack occurred, how well you have recovered, or how healthy you feel now.</p>

<h3>Why Heart Attack History Is Disqualifying</h3>

<p>The plasmapheresis process involves removing a significant volume of blood, separating the plasma, and returning the remaining components to your body. This process causes temporary fluid shifts and changes in blood volume that put stress on the cardiovascular system. For someone whose heart muscle has been damaged by a heart attack, these stresses pose unacceptable risks, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Potential for another cardiac event during the procedure</li>
<li>Blood pressure fluctuations that a weakened heart may not tolerate</li>
<li>Fluid volume shifts that could cause complications</li>
<li>The fact that most post-heart attack patients are on blood thinners (an additional disqualifier)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a consistent policy across CSL Plasma, BioLife, Grifols, Octapharma, and other major companies. Even if one center's staff seems willing to consider it, corporate medical guidelines at all major chains list heart attack history as a permanent deferral.</p>

<h2 id="heart-failure">Heart Failure</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With Heart Failure?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: No. Heart failure of any class is a permanent deferral.</strong></p>

<p>Heart failure means the heart cannot pump blood as efficiently as it should. It is classified into four stages (NYHA Class I through IV), ranging from mild limitations to severe disability. Regardless of which class you fall into, heart failure is a permanent disqualifier for plasma donation.</p>

<p>Even Class I heart failure, where you have no symptoms during ordinary physical activity, is disqualifying. The concern is that the plasmapheresis process involves significant fluid shifts. When blood is drawn, processed, and returned, the changes in blood volume can stress a heart that is already struggling to maintain adequate circulation. For someone with heart failure, this can potentially trigger:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fluid overload when red blood cells are returned with saline</li>
<li>Dangerous drops in blood pressure during blood withdrawal</li>
<li>Worsening of heart failure symptoms</li>
<li>Pulmonary edema in severe cases</li>
</ul>

<p>This deferral is non-negotiable and applies at every major plasma center in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="cad">Coronary Artery Disease</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With Coronary Artery Disease?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: Usually no, especially if you have had stents, bypass surgery, or ongoing symptoms.</strong></p>

<p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves the buildup of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The eligibility picture is generally negative for people with CAD, but there is some nuance:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosed CAD with stents or bypass surgery:</strong> This is a permanent deferral at most centers. The history of intervention indicates significant disease, and these patients are typically on blood thinners and other medications that independently disqualify them.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosed CAD managed with medication only:</strong> Still usually disqualifying. Even if you have not had a procedure, the diagnosis itself and the medications prescribed for it (often including blood thinners or antiplatelet drugs) will likely disqualify you.</li>
<li><strong>Mild CAD found incidentally:</strong> In rare cases where mild CAD is found on imaging but requires no treatment, the center's physician may consider your case individually. However, most centers err on the side of caution.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that if you carry a formal diagnosis of coronary artery disease, you should expect to be deferred. The combination of the underlying disease, the medications typically prescribed, and the cardiovascular stress of plasmapheresis makes donation too risky.</p>

<h2 id="pacemaker">Pacemaker or Implantable Defibrillator (ICD)</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With a Pacemaker?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: Policies vary significantly between centers. Call ahead before visiting.</strong></p>

<p>The presence of a pacemaker or ICD is one of the more inconsistent eligibility criteria across plasma centers. Here is what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Some centers have a blanket deferral:</strong> They will not accept any donor with an implanted cardiac device, regardless of the reason for the device or the donor's current health status.</li>
<li><strong>Some centers evaluate case by case:</strong> They consider why the device was implanted, what underlying condition it treats, and whether the donor is otherwise healthy and stable.</li>
<li><strong>The underlying condition often matters more:</strong> A pacemaker implanted for a slow heart rate (bradycardia) in an otherwise healthy person is viewed differently than a defibrillator implanted after a cardiac arrest.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Before You Visit</h3>

<p>If you have a pacemaker or ICD, do not just show up at a plasma center. Call ahead and ask specifically about their policy on implanted cardiac devices. Questions to ask include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you accept donors with pacemakers or defibrillators?</li>
<li>What documentation do I need to bring?</li>
<li>Will I need a clearance letter from my cardiologist?</li>
<li>Does the reason for my device matter?</li>
</ul>

<p>This will save you the frustration of going through registration only to be deferred at the medical screening stage.</p>

<h2 id="congenital">Congenital Heart Defects</h2>

<h3>Can You Donate Plasma With a Congenital Heart Defect?</h3>

<p><strong>Short answer: It depends on the specific defect, whether it was repaired, and your current heart function.</strong></p>

<p>Congenital heart defects are structural heart problems present from birth. They range enormously in severity, from a small atrial septal defect that closed on its own in childhood to complex conditions requiring multiple surgeries. Eligibility depends on several factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minor defects that resolved:</strong> Small holes (like a patent foramen ovale or small ASD) that closed on their own or were repaired in childhood with no residual effects may be accepted, especially with documentation from your cardiologist.</li>
<li><strong>Repaired defects with normal heart function:</strong> If your defect was surgically repaired and you now have normal heart function with no ongoing medications, some centers may accept you. A cardiologist's clearance letter will be essential.</li>
<li><strong>Complex or unrepaired defects:</strong> More serious congenital conditions, or those that required multiple surgeries or still affect heart function, are generally disqualifying.</li>
<li><strong>Current medication:</strong> As with other conditions, if your congenital heart defect requires you to take blood thinners or other disqualifying medications, the medication itself becomes the barrier to donation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because congenital heart defects are so varied, there is no universal policy. You will need to discuss your specific condition with the center's medical staff. Bring detailed records from your cardiologist, including your most recent echocardiogram and a statement about your current functional status.</p>

<h2 id="blood-thinners">Blood Thinners and Heart Medications</h2>

<p>For many people with heart conditions, the medication is what actually disqualifies them from donating plasma, not the condition itself. Here is a breakdown of common heart medications and their impact on eligibility.</p>

<h3>Medications That Disqualify You (Permanent Deferral)</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Medication</th><th>Brand Names</th><th>Why It Disqualifies</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Warfarin</td><td>Coumadin, Jantoven</td><td>Blood thinner; risk of uncontrolled bleeding from venipuncture</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apixaban</td><td>Eliquis</td><td>Blood thinner; same bleeding risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rivaroxaban</td><td>Xarelto</td><td>Blood thinner; same bleeding risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dabigatran</td><td>Pradaxa</td><td>Blood thinner; same bleeding risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Edoxaban</td><td>Savaysa</td><td>Blood thinner; same bleeding risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heparin / Enoxaparin</td><td>Lovenox</td><td>Blood thinner; same bleeding risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clopidogrel</td><td>Plavix</td><td>Antiplatelet drug; affects clotting after needle removal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ticagrelor</td><td>Brilinta</td><td>Antiplatelet drug; same clotting concern</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prasugrel</td><td>Effient</td><td>Antiplatelet drug; same clotting concern</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>These medications prevent your blood from clotting properly. During plasma donation, a large-gauge needle is inserted into your arm and remains there for 45 to 90 minutes. When the needle is removed, your body needs to form a clot quickly to stop the bleeding. If you are on blood thinners, this process is impaired, creating a risk of prolonged bleeding, hematoma formation, or more serious complications.</p>

<h3>Aspirin: A Special Case</h3>

<p><strong>Low-dose aspirin (81mg daily) is usually accepted.</strong> This is the "baby aspirin" that many people take for heart health. While aspirin does have mild blood-thinning effects, the low dose used for prevention does not pose the same bleeding risk as prescription anticoagulants.</p>

<p><strong>High-dose aspirin (325mg or more):</strong> Policies vary. Some centers accept donors on regular-strength aspirin, while others may defer you temporarily. If you take high-dose aspirin, check with your specific center.</p>

<h3>Blood Pressure Medications That Are Usually Accepted</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>ACE inhibitors</strong> (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril)</li>
<li><strong>ARBs</strong> (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan)</li>
<li><strong>Beta-blockers</strong> (metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol)</li>
<li><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> (amlodipine, diltiazem, verapamil)</li>
<li><strong>Diuretics</strong> (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, spironolactone)</li>
</ul>

<p>These medications are generally fine for plasma donation. They control blood pressure, which is exactly what the center wants, but they do not affect your blood's ability to clot. If you take any of these for hypertension, you should be eligible as long as your blood pressure reading at screening is within acceptable limits.</p>

<h3>Statins and Cholesterol Medications</h3>

<p>Cholesterol-lowering medications like statins (atorvastatin/Lipitor, rosuvastatin/Crestor, simvastatin/Zocor) are accepted at all major plasma centers. These medications are extremely common and have no impact on the donation process or your blood's clotting ability.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why Heart Conditions Matter for Plasma Donation Safety</h2>

<p>Understanding why plasma centers screen for heart conditions helps you appreciate that these rules exist to protect you, not to inconvenience you. The plasmapheresis process places several specific demands on your cardiovascular system.</p>

<h3>What Happens to Your Body During Plasma Donation</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Blood withdrawal phase:</strong> Blood is drawn from your vein at a controlled rate. This temporarily reduces your blood volume, which your heart must compensate for by adjusting heart rate and blood vessel tone.</li>
<li><strong>Separation phase:</strong> The machine separates plasma from the rest of your blood components. During this time, a portion of your blood volume is outside your body in the machine.</li>
<li><strong>Return phase:</strong> Red blood cells and other components are returned to you, typically mixed with a small amount of saline and anticoagulant (citrate). Your cardiovascular system must handle this fluid returning to your circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat cycles:</strong> This draw-separate-return cycle repeats several times over the course of 45 to 90 minutes, creating repeated fluid shifts that require ongoing cardiovascular adjustment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Specific Risks for Heart Condition Patients</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blood pressure drops:</strong> The temporary reduction in blood volume can cause blood pressure to drop. A healthy heart compensates easily. A compromised heart may not respond quickly enough, leading to dizziness, fainting, or more serious events.</li>
<li><strong>Fluid overload:</strong> When blood components and saline are returned, there is a brief increase in blood volume. For someone with heart failure, this can push the heart beyond its capacity and cause fluid to back up into the lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Arrhythmia triggers:</strong> The citrate anticoagulant used in the machine temporarily binds calcium in your blood. Calcium is critical for heart rhythm, and the transient reduction can potentially trigger arrhythmias in susceptible individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Bleeding complications:</strong> For anyone on blood thinners, the large-bore needle used in plasmapheresis creates a significant puncture wound. Without proper clotting, this can lead to prolonged bleeding or large bruises (hematomas) that may require medical attention.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screening">The Screening Process: What Catches Heart Issues</h2>

<p>Every single plasma donation visit includes a health screening designed to catch cardiovascular problems before they become dangerous. Here is what happens and what the staff is looking for.</p>

<h3>Vital Signs Checked Every Visit</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Vital Sign</th><th>Acceptable Range</th><th>Why It Is Checked</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Blood pressure</td><td>Below 180/100</td><td>High BP increases risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pulse rate</td><td>50-100 bpm</td><td>Abnormal heart rate may indicate cardiac problems</td></tr>
<tr><td>Temperature</td><td>Below 99.5&deg;F</td><td>Fever can indicate infection or inflammation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hematocrit / Hemoglobin</td><td>Varies by center</td><td>Ensures you have enough red blood cells</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>The Health Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Before every donation, you complete a health questionnaire that asks about your medical history, including heart conditions and medications. It is critical that you answer these questions honestly. The questions are designed to protect your safety. Lying about a heart condition to pass the screening puts your health at serious risk.</p>

<p>The questionnaire will ask about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any heart conditions you have been diagnosed with</li>
<li>All medications you are currently taking</li>
<li>Any changes in your health since your last visit</li>
<li>Symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Examination (First Visit)</h3>

<p>On your very first visit to a plasma center, you will undergo a more thorough physical examination. A medical professional will listen to your heart with a stethoscope, which can detect murmurs, irregular rhythms, and other abnormalities. If anything concerning is found, you may be asked to provide additional medical documentation before being cleared to donate.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Be Honest at Screening</h3>
<p>Never hide a heart condition from the screening staff. The questions exist to protect you. Plasma donation is extremely safe for healthy individuals, but it can be genuinely dangerous for someone with an unmanaged heart condition. A deferral is not a punishment. It is a safety measure that could prevent a medical emergency.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with a heart murmur?</h3>
<p>In most cases, yes. If your heart murmur has been diagnosed as benign or innocent by a doctor, most plasma centers will accept you. Functional murmurs that cause no symptoms are generally fine. You may need to provide a doctor's clearance letter documenting that the murmur has been evaluated and is not clinically significant.</p>

<h3>Does high blood pressure disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. Most plasma centers accept donors with controlled hypertension as long as your reading at the time of donation is below 180/100. If your blood pressure is above this threshold at screening, you will be deferred for that visit but can return another day when your reading is lower. Most standard blood pressure medications are accepted.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you take blood thinners?</h3>
<p>No. Prescription anticoagulants like Warfarin (Coumadin), Eliquis (apixaban), Xarelto (rivaroxaban), and Pradaxa (dabigatran) are permanent deferrals at all major plasma centers. These medications prevent your blood from clotting properly, making the large-gauge needle used in plasmapheresis a bleeding risk. Low-dose aspirin (81mg) is usually acceptable.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma after a heart attack?</h3>
<p>Generally no. A history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) is a permanent deferral at most plasma centers. The physical stress of plasmapheresis, including temporary blood volume changes and fluid shifts, poses risks for people whose heart muscle has been damaged by a previous cardiac event. This applies regardless of how long ago the heart attack occurred.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with a pacemaker?</h3>
<p>Policies vary by center. Some plasma centers accept donors with pacemakers if the underlying condition is stable and the donor is otherwise healthy, while others have a blanket deferral policy for any implanted cardiac device. Call your specific center to ask about their policy before visiting to avoid a wasted trip.</p>

<h3>What blood pressure do you need to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Your blood pressure must be below 180/100 at the time of donation. Most centers prefer readings closer to normal ranges, and staff may monitor you more closely if your reading is elevated but still under the threshold. If your reading is too high at screening, you will be temporarily deferred and can try again another day. Taking your medication as prescribed and avoiding caffeine before your visit can help.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with mitral valve prolapse?</h3>
<p>Usually yes. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) without significant regurgitation is accepted at most plasma centers. If your MVP is asymptomatic and your doctor has cleared you for normal physical activity, you should be eligible. Bring documentation from your doctor confirming the diagnosis is mild and requires no activity restrictions.</p>

<h3>What heart conditions permanently disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Permanent deferrals typically include: history of heart attack, heart failure of any class, severe coronary artery disease (especially with stents or bypass surgery), history of cardiac arrest, heart transplant, and use of prescription blood thinners like Warfarin, Eliquis, or Xarelto. These conditions or medications indicate cardiovascular risk that makes the plasmapheresis process unsafe.</p>
