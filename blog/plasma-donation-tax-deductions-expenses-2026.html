    <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
    <p><strong>Plasma donation income is classified as "other income" &mdash; NOT self-employment income.</strong> This means standard Schedule C business deductions don't apply. However, you MAY be able to deduct certain expenses related to producing this income (like mileage, parking, and tolls) as miscellaneous deductions. The IRS classification is debated, and you should consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="key-rule">Key Tax Classification Rule</h2>

<p>Understanding how the IRS classifies plasma income is essential for knowing what you can deduct:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classification</th>
            <th>Tax Form</th>
            <th>Deductions Available</th>
            <th>Applies to Plasma?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>W-2 Wages</strong></td>
            <td>Form W-2</td>
            <td>Standard employee deductions</td>
            <td>No &mdash; you're not an employee</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Self-Employment</strong></td>
            <td>Schedule C</td>
            <td>Full business expense deductions</td>
            <td>Generally no (debated)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Other Income</strong></td>
            <td>Line 8 of Schedule 1</td>
            <td>Limited expense deductions</td>
            <td>Yes &mdash; most common classification</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>Because plasma income is typically "other income," you cannot simply file a Schedule C and deduct all your expenses like a business. However, the IRS does allow deductions for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred to produce income &mdash; including certain plasma donation expenses.</p>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Important Caveat</p>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Some tax professionals argue plasma donation IS self-employment activity, which would allow Schedule C deductions. The IRS has not issued definitive guidance. If you earn significant plasma income ($5,000+/year), consulting a CPA is strongly recommended.</p>

<h2 id="deductible-expenses">Potentially Deductible Expenses</h2>

<p>The following expenses MAY be deductible as costs of producing plasma income:</p>

<h3>Transportation Costs (Strongest Case)</h3>

            <th>Expense</th>
            <th>Deductible?</th>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Mileage to/from center</strong></td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Parking fees at center</strong></td>
            <td>Yes (likely)</td>
            <td>Actual receipts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Tolls on route</strong></td>
            <td>Yes (likely)</td>
            <td>Actual receipts or toll records</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Public transit fares</strong></td>
            <td>Yes (likely)</td>
            <td>Actual cost of bus/train/rideshare</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Actual vehicle expenses</strong></td>
            <td>Alternative to mileage</td>
            <td>Gas, maintenance, insurance (prorated for plasma trips only)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example: Mileage Deduction Calculation</h3>

<p>If your plasma center is 15 miles from home and you donate twice weekly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Round trip:</strong> 30 miles per visit</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly trips:</strong> 8 visits = 240 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Annual miles:</strong> ~2,880 miles</li>
    <li><strong>2026 IRS rate:</strong> $0.70/mile (estimated)</li>
    <li><strong>Annual deduction:</strong> ~$2,016</li>
</ul>

<p>That $2,016 deduction could save you $300&ndash;$500+ in taxes depending on your tax bracket.</p>

<h2 id="mileage-rates">2026 Standard Mileage Rate</h2>

<p>The IRS sets a standard mileage rate each year. Here's the recent history:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Tax Year</th>
            <th>Standard Mileage Rate</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2024</td>
            <td>$0.67/mile</td>
            <td>Business standard rate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2025</td>
            <td>$0.70/mile</td>
            <td>Increased for inflation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2026 (estimated)</td>
            <td>$0.70&ndash;$0.72/mile</td>
            <td>Official rate expected January 2026</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You must choose either the standard mileage rate OR actual vehicle expenses for the tax year. You cannot use both methods simultaneously. The standard mileage rate is simpler and usually more beneficial for most donors.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-deduct">How to Claim Deductions</h2>

<p>The method for claiming plasma-related deductions depends on how you classify your income:</p>

<h3>Option 1: Other Income with Expense Offset (Most Common)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Report plasma income on Schedule 1, Line 8z ("Other income")</li>
    <li>Subtract deductible expenses to report the net amount</li>
    <li>Attach a statement explaining the expenses if significant</li>
</ol>

<h3>Option 2: Schedule C (If Treating as Self-Employment)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Report plasma income as business revenue</li>
    <li>Deduct all ordinary and necessary business expenses</li>
    <li>Pay self-employment tax (15.3%) on net profit</li>
    <li><strong>Caution:</strong> This triggers SE tax, which may cost more than the deductions save</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="record-keeping">Record-Keeping Tips for Plasma Donors</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Keep a mileage log:</strong> Record the date, destination (center name), and miles driven for each donation trip</li>
    <li><strong>Save all receipts:</strong> Parking receipts, toll records, and any other deductible expenses</li>
    <li><strong>Track all payments received:</strong> Screenshot or export your payment history from the center's app or card portal</li>
    <li><strong>Note your odometer:</strong> Record starting and ending odometer readings on January 1 and December 31</li>
    <li><strong>Use a simple spreadsheet:</strong> Date, center, round-trip miles, parking, tolls, amount received &mdash; that's all you need</li>
    <li><strong>Keep records for 3 years:</strong> The IRS can audit returns up to 3 years back (6 years if income is understated by 25%+)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I deduct mileage driving to and from plasma donations?</h3>
<p>Most likely yes. Mileage driven to produce taxable income is generally deductible. Keep a detailed mileage log with dates, destinations, and round-trip distances. Use the IRS standard mileage rate ($0.70/mile for 2025, similar expected for 2026) to calculate your deduction.</p>

<h3>Is plasma donation income self-employment income?</h3>
<p>The IRS has not issued definitive guidance. Most tax professionals classify it as "other income" (Schedule 1, Line 8z), not self-employment income. Some argue it could qualify as self-employment, which would allow Schedule C deductions but also trigger self-employment tax (15.3%). Consult a CPA for your situation.</p>

<h3>Can I deduct food and supplements I buy for plasma donations?</h3>
<p>No. Food, water, vitamins, and supplements are considered personal living expenses by the IRS, even if they help you pass screening or donate faster. These are not deductible as expenses of producing income.</p>

<h3>Do I need to itemize to deduct plasma expenses?</h3>
<p>If you report plasma as "other income," you may be able to offset expenses directly against the income on Schedule 1 without itemizing. If using Schedule A miscellaneous deductions, you would need to itemize. The best approach depends on your total deductions versus the standard deduction.</p>

<h3>What happens if I don't report plasma income on my taxes?</h3>
<p>If a center pays you more than $600 in a year, they report it to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC. The IRS will match this against your return and may send a notice for unreported income plus penalties and interest. Even below $600, you are legally required to report the income.</p>
