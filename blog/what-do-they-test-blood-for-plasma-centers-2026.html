<article class="blog-content">

<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>Plasma centers test your blood for total protein (6.0-9.0 g/dL), hemoglobin/hematocrit (anemia check), HIV-1/HIV-2, Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and ALT liver enzymes. Initial visits include comprehensive infectious disease screening. Protein, hemoglobin, and vital signs are checked before every donation. Tests every 4 months for ongoing disease screening.</p></div>

<p>If you're considering plasma donation, understanding what blood tests you'll undergo is essential. Plasma centers follow strict FDA regulations to ensure both donor safety and plasma product safety. This comprehensive guide covers every test you'll encounter, from your first visit to routine donations.</p>

<p>The screening process protects you from donating when it's unsafe and ensures your plasma is suitable for manufacturing life-saving medications. Let's break down exactly what they test for and why.</p>

<h2 id="every-visit">Tests Done at Every Single Visit</h2>

<p>Before every plasma donation, centers perform several quick tests to verify you're healthy enough to donate that day. These are non-negotiable requirements that happen at each visit.</p>

<h3>Vital Signs Check</h3>
<p>Every donation begins with vital signs measurement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood pressure:</strong> Must be below 180/100 mmHg. High blood pressure can indicate stress, illness, or cardiovascular issues that make donation unsafe.</li>
<li><strong>Pulse rate:</strong> Typically 50-100 beats per minute. Abnormal heart rate may indicate dehydration, anxiety, or heart problems.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Must be below 99.5°F (37.5°C). Fever indicates possible infection, which disqualifies you from donating.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weight Verification</h3>
<p>You're weighed at every visit because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum weight:</strong> 110 pounds (50 kg) is required for safety. Lower weight means lower blood volume, making donation risky.</li>
<li><strong>Donation volume:</strong> Your weight determines how much plasma can be safely collected. Under 150 lbs donates 690-825 mL, while 175+ lbs can donate up to 880-1000 mL.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation tier:</strong> Higher weight often means higher pay since you can donate more plasma volume.</li>
</ul>

<table><thead><tr><th>Weight Range</th><th>Plasma Volume</th><th>Typical Pay Range</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>110-149 lbs</td><td>690-825 mL</td><td>Lower tier</td></tr>
<tr><td>150-174 lbs</td><td>825-880 mL</td><td>Mid tier</td></tr>
<tr><td>175-400 lbs</td><td>880-1000 mL</td><td>Higher tier</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Finger Stick Tests</h3>
<p>A small finger prick provides blood for two critical measurements done at every donation:</p>

<h4>Total Protein Test</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceptable range:</strong> 6.0 to 9.0 g/dL at most centers</li>
<li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Protein levels indicate whether your body has enough protein reserves to safely donate plasma</li>
<li><strong>Deferral threshold:</strong> Below 6.0 g/dL results in temporary deferral</li>
<li><strong>How to improve:</strong> Eat high-protein foods like eggs, chicken, Greek yogurt, or protein shakes before donation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hemoglobin/Hematocrit Test</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hemoglobin minimums:</strong> 12.5 g/dL for women, 13.0 g/dL for men</li>
<li><strong>Hematocrit minimums:</strong> 38% for women, 39% for men (some centers use this instead)</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevents anemia by ensuring adequate red blood cell levels</li>
<li><strong>Common causes of low levels:</strong> Iron deficiency, recent blood loss, frequent donation, poor diet</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="infectious-disease">Infectious Disease Screening Tests</h2>

<p>These tests protect the plasma supply and patients who receive plasma-derived medications. FDA regulations require comprehensive screening for blood-borne pathogens.</p>

<h3>HIV Testing (HIV-1 and HIV-2)</h3>
<p>All plasma undergoes rigorous HIV screening using multiple methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antibody tests:</strong> Detect immune response to HIV infection</li>
<li><strong>NAT (Nucleic Acid Testing):</strong> Detects HIV genetic material, catching infections in the "window period" before antibodies develop</li>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Initial donation and every 4 months for repeat donors</li>
<li><strong>Positive result:</strong> Permanent deferral from all plasma and blood donation</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> You're notified privately and referred for confirmatory testing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hepatitis B Testing</h3>
<p>Centers screen for active Hepatitis B infection using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen):</strong> Indicates active or chronic infection</li>
<li><strong>Anti-HBc (Hepatitis B core antibody):</strong> May indicate past or present infection</li>
<li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Hepatitis B damages the liver and can be transmitted through plasma products</li>
<li><strong>Vaccination status:</strong> Being vaccinated for Hep B does NOT disqualify you. Vaccination creates different antibodies (anti-HBs) that don't trigger positive results.</li>
<li><strong>Positive result:</strong> Permanent deferral. Even past infections leave markers that disqualify donation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hepatitis C Testing</h3>
<p>Hepatitis C screening includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-HCV antibody test:</strong> Detects immune response to Hepatitis C virus</li>
<li><strong>NAT for HCV RNA:</strong> Detects active virus in blood</li>
<li><strong>Why both tests:</strong> Antibodies persist even after successful treatment, and NAT catches new infections</li>
<li><strong>Treatment consideration:</strong> Even if you've been cured with antivirals, antibodies remain, permanently disqualifying you from donation</li>
<li><strong>Risk factors:</strong> Past IV drug use, tattoos in unregulated settings, blood transfusions before 1992</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syphilis Testing (RPR Test)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test type:</strong> RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) detects syphilis antibodies</li>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Initial visit and every 4 months</li>
<li><strong>Why it's tested:</strong> Syphilis can be transmitted through blood and indicates sexual health risk factors</li>
<li><strong>False positives:</strong> Certain autoimmune conditions can cause false positives, requiring confirmatory testing</li>
<li><strong>Positive result:</strong> Temporary or permanent deferral depending on active vs. treated infection</li>
</ul>

</section>

<h3>ALT Liver Enzyme Test</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it measures:</strong> Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a liver enzyme that increases when liver cells are damaged</li>
<li><strong>Normal range:</strong> Below 45-60 IU/L (varies by center)</li>
<li><strong>High ALT causes:</strong> Hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol use, certain medications, liver damage</li>
<li><strong>Why it's tested:</strong> Elevated ALT may indicate undetected hepatitis or liver disease</li>
<li><strong>Result impact:</strong> Significantly elevated levels cause temporary deferral and recommendation to see a doctor</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protein-levels">Understanding Total Protein Testing</h2>

<p>Total protein measurement is one of the most common reasons donors are temporarily deferred. Here's what you need to know.</p>

<h3>Why Protein Matters</h3>
<p>Plasma is approximately 7% protein by composition. When you donate plasma, you're removing a significant amount of protein from your body. Testing ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have adequate protein reserves to donate safely</li>
<li>Your body can replace the donated protein without health consequences</li>
<li>The collected plasma has sufficient protein concentration for manufacturing medications</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Protein Levels</h3>
<p>If you're struggling with protein levels, try these strategies:</p>

<h4>Day-Before Preparation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat 80-100g protein the day before donation</li>
<li>Examples: 6oz chicken breast (52g), 2 eggs (12g), Greek yogurt (15-20g), protein shake (25-30g)</li>
<li>Avoid excessive alcohol, which can lower protein temporarily</li>
</ul>

<h4>Morning of Donation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat a high-protein breakfast 1-2 hours before your appointment</li>
<li>Eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake, or protein bars work well</li>
<li>Avoid extremely fatty foods that can affect test accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h4>Chronic Low Protein Issues</h4>
<p>If you're frequently deferred for low protein, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing daily protein intake to 0.8-1.0g per pound of body weight</li>
<li>Spacing donations further apart (once per week instead of twice)</li>
<li>Consulting a doctor to rule out kidney disease, malnutrition, or absorption issues</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hemoglobin-hematocrit">Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Testing</h2>

<p>These tests prevent anemia from plasma donation by ensuring you have enough red blood cells.</p>

<h3>What's the Difference?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hemoglobin:</strong> Measures the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells (g/dL)</li>
<li><strong>Hematocrit:</strong> Measures the percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells</li>
<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Hematocrit is roughly 3x hemoglobin (hemoglobin 13.0 = hematocrit ~39%)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why You Might Be Deferred</h3>
<p>Common causes of low hemoglobin/hematocrit in plasma donors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iron deficiency:</strong> Most common cause, especially in women and frequent donors</li>
<li><strong>Donation frequency:</strong> Donating twice weekly for months can deplete iron stores</li>
<li><strong>Recent illness:</strong> Infections, heavy menstruation, or blood loss</li>
<li><strong>Dietary factors:</strong> Vegetarian/vegan diet without iron supplementation</li>
<li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Chronic disease, kidney problems, or blood disorders</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Improve Your Levels</h3>

<h4>Dietary Iron Sources</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heme iron (better absorbed):</strong> Red meat, poultry, fish, organ meats</li>
<li><strong>Non-heme iron:</strong> Beans, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals, tofu</li>
<li><strong>Absorption boosters:</strong> Vitamin C (citrus, tomatoes, peppers) consumed with iron-rich foods</li>
<li><strong>Avoid with meals:</strong> Coffee, tea, calcium supplements can block iron absorption</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supplementation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Iron supplements: 18-65mg daily (consult doctor first)</li>
<li>Take with vitamin C for better absorption</li>
<li>Common side effects: Constipation, dark stools, stomach upset</li>
<li>Takes 2-3 months to fully replenish iron stores</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-vs-ongoing">Initial Visit vs. Ongoing Screening</h2>

<p>The testing frequency and comprehensiveness differs between your first donation and subsequent visits.</p>

<h3>Initial Donation Screening (First Visit)</h3>
<p>Your first visit includes the most comprehensive testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete physical exam:</strong> Medical history, current medications, risk factor assessment</li>
<li><strong>Full infectious disease panel:</strong> HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, syphilis, ALT</li>
<li><strong>Baseline testing:</strong> Protein, hemoglobin/hematocrit, vital signs, weight</li>
<li><strong>Vein assessment:</strong> Ensuring suitable veins for safe plasmapheresis</li>
<li><strong>Questionnaire:</strong> Detailed health and lifestyle questions</li>
<li><strong>Results timing:</strong> Takes 1-3 days to process. Some centers allow donation before results (quarantined plasma), others make you wait.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Second Donation Visit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mini-physical and health questionnaire</li>
<li>Vital signs, weight, protein, hemoglobin (same as ongoing)</li>
<li>No additional infectious disease testing required</li>
<li>Must wait at least 2 days since first donation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing Regular Donations</h3>
<p>For established donors, testing includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every visit:</strong> Vital signs, weight, protein, hemoglobin/hematocrit, health questionnaire</li>
<li><strong>Every 4 months:</strong> Full infectious disease panel (HIV, Hepatitis B/C, syphilis, ALT)</li>
<li><strong>Annually:</strong> Updated medical history and physical exam at some centers</li>
<li><strong>Random selection:</strong> NAT testing on every donation as quality control</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="drug-testing">Do Plasma Centers Test for Drugs?</h2>

<p>This is one of the most common questions from potential donors. The answer is nuanced.</p>

<h3>Routine Drug Screening</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers do NOT routinely test donated plasma for recreational drugs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marijuana/THC</li>
<li>Cocaine</li>
<li>Methamphetamine</li>
<li>Opioids (heroin, fentanyl)</li>
<li>Benzodiazepines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Drugs Aren't Routinely Tested</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plasma undergoes extensive purification and fractionation that removes most substances</li>
<li>Manufacturing processes include viral inactivation steps that also remove many contaminants</li>
<li>Cost: Adding drug screening to every donation would be prohibitively expensive</li>
<li>Focus is on infectious disease transmission rather than drug contamination</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Drug Testing Might Occur</h3>
<p>Centers may test or refuse donation if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You appear visibly impaired or intoxicated during screening</li>
<li>You fail the health questionnaire (admitting recent drug use)</li>
<li>Track marks or signs of IV drug use are visible</li>
<li>Center policy includes random drug screening (rare, but some facilities do this)</li>
<li>You're taking prescription medications that disqualify you</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medications That May Disqualify You</h3>

<h2 id="what-if-fail">What Happens If You Fail a Blood Test?</h2>

<p>Understanding the consequences and next steps for failed tests helps you prepare and respond appropriately.</p>

<h3>Temporary Deferral (Protein, Hemoglobin, Vital Signs)</h3>
<p>If you fail non-infectious disease tests, you're temporarily deferred:</p>

<h4>Low Protein (Below 6.0 g/dL)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deferral period:</strong> Usually 1-2 days, but can return same day after eating protein-rich meal at some centers</li>
<li><strong>What to do:</strong> Increase protein intake, eat high-protein meal before next attempt</li>
<li><strong>Chronic issues:</strong> See a doctor if you're repeatedly deferred for protein</li>
</ul>

<h4>Low Hemoglobin/Hematocrit</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deferral period:</strong> Typically 7-30 days depending on severity</li>
<li><strong>What to do:</strong> Increase iron intake through diet or supplements, reduce donation frequency</li>
<li><strong>Medical attention:</strong> Persistent low hemoglobin may indicate anemia requiring treatment</li>
</ul>

<h4>High Blood Pressure or Pulse</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deferral period:</strong> Often can retry after 15 minutes rest, or 1-7 days if significantly elevated</li>
<li><strong>What to do:</strong> Relax, hydrate, avoid caffeine before donation</li>
<li><strong>Chronic hypertension:</strong> Get medical clearance and medication management if ongoing issue</li>
</ul>

<h3>Permanent Deferral (Infectious Disease Positive)</h3>
<p>Positive results for infectious diseases have serious consequences:</p>

<h4>Notification Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Center contacts you confidentially within 1-7 days of positive result</li>
<li>Information is protected under HIPAA privacy laws</li>
<li>You're referred for confirmatory testing (initial screening may be false positive)</li>
<li>Medical counseling and resources are typically provided</li>
</ul>

<h4>Permanent Deferral Conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li>HIV-1 or HIV-2 positive</li>
<li>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive</li>
<li>Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-HCV) positive, even if treated and cured</li>
<li>Syphilis positive (may be temporary if successfully treated, depending on center policy)</li>
<li>HTLV-I or HTLV-II positive (Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Plasma Is Not Used</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any donations showing positive results are immediately quarantined and destroyed</li>
<li>Previous donations may be recalled if recent infection is detected</li>
<li>You're added to national donor deferral registry</li>
<li>Cannot donate at any plasma or blood center in the United States</li>
</ul>

<h3>False Positives</h3>
<p>Screening tests occasionally produce false positive results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmatory testing uses more specific methods to verify results</li>
<li>If confirmatory test is negative, deferral may be lifted</li>
<li>Some conditions (pregnancy, autoimmune disease) can cause false positives</li>
<li>Always follow up with confirmatory testing before assuming diagnosis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fda-requirements">FDA Requirements for Plasma Testing</h2>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What blood tests are required to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Plasma centers test for total protein (6.0-9.0 g/dL), hemoglobin/hematocrit (anemia check), HIV-1 and HIV-2, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibodies, syphilis via RPR test, and ALT liver enzyme levels. Initial screening includes all tests, while ongoing donors are re-tested for infectious diseases every 4 months. Protein, hemoglobin, and vital signs are checked before every donation.</p>

<h3>Do plasma centers test for drugs in your blood?</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers do not routinely test donated blood for recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, or opioids. The manufacturing process purifies plasma extensively, removing most contaminants. However, centers may test or refuse donation if you appear impaired during screening or have visible signs of IV drug use. Certain prescription medications like blood thinners or Accutane can disqualify you temporarily or permanently.</p>

<h3>How often do plasma centers test your blood?</h3>
<p>Initial donation includes comprehensive infectious disease screening for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and liver function. Ongoing donors are re-tested for these infectious diseases every 4 months (120 days) as required by FDA regulations. Before every single donation, centers check your total protein, hemoglobin or hematocrit, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature to ensure you're healthy enough to donate that day.</p>

<h3>What is the minimum protein level to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers require total protein levels between 6.0 and 9.0 g/dL to donate. Levels below 6.0 g/dL typically result in temporary deferral, usually for 1-2 days. To meet this requirement, eat high-protein foods like eggs, chicken, Greek yogurt, or protein shakes before donation. Aim for 80-100g of protein the day before and a protein-rich meal 1-2 hours before your appointment.</p>

<h3>What happens if you fail a plasma center blood test?</h3>
<p>If you fail protein or hemoglobin tests, you receive temporary deferral ranging from same-day retry (after eating protein) to 7-30 days for low hemoglobin. If you test positive for infectious diseases like HIV, Hepatitis B or C, or syphilis, you're permanently deferred from all plasma and blood donation. You're notified confidentially and referred for confirmatory testing. Your plasma is quarantined and destroyed, never used for manufacturing.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have hepatitis antibodies?</h3>
<p>No, you cannot donate plasma if you test positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV). This results in permanent deferral from plasma donation. Even if you've been successfully treated and cured of Hepatitis C with antiviral medications, the antibodies remain in your blood permanently and disqualify you from donating. Hepatitis B vaccination does not disqualify you, as it creates different antibodies.</p>

<h3>What is a normal hemoglobin level for plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Women need minimum hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL to donate plasma, while men need 13.0 g/dL or higher. Some centers use hematocrit instead, requiring 38% minimum for women and 39% for men. These minimums prevent anemia from developing due to plasma donation. If you're below these levels, you're temporarily deferred for 7-30 days. Increase iron intake through diet or supplements to improve levels.</p>

<h3>Do plasma centers check for STDs beyond HIV?</h3>
<p>Yes, plasma centers test for sexually transmitted diseases beyond HIV. All donations are screened for syphilis using the RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test. Additionally, centers test for HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C - all of which can be sexually transmitted. Testing positive for any of these infectious diseases results in permanent deferral from plasma and blood donation. You're notified confidentially and referred for confirmatory testing.</p>

<h3>Why do they check your weight at plasma centers?</h3>
<p>Weight determines both donation safety and plasma volume collected. Minimum weight is 110 pounds to ensure adequate blood volume for safe donation. Your weight determines how much plasma can be safely extracted: donors under 150 lbs give 690-825 mL, while those 175+ pounds can donate 880-1000 mL. Heavier donors often earn higher pay because they can donate more plasma. Weight is verified at every visit to adjust collection volume.</p>

<h3>What does ALT test measure in plasma donation?</h3>
<p>ALT (alanine aminotransferase) measures a liver enzyme that increases when liver cells are damaged or diseased. Most plasma centers require ALT levels below 60-100 IU/L. Elevated ALT may indicate hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver damage, or other liver conditions. Significantly high levels result in temporary deferral and recommendation to see a physician. ALT is tested at initial donation and every 4 months for ongoing donors.</p>
