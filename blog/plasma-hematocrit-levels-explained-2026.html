<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>Hematocrit measures the percentage of red blood cells in your blood. Plasma centers require 38-54% for women and 39-54% for men. Low hematocrit is the most common deferral reason. Raise it by eating iron-rich foods, staying hydrated, and spacing donations appropriately.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-is">What Is Hematocrit?</h2>
<p>Hematocrit (HCT) is a blood test that measures what percentage of your blood is made up of red blood cells. It's one of the most important screening tests for plasma donation.</p>

<h3>How It's Measured</h3>
<p>During screening, a staff member pricks your finger and collects a small blood sample. This sample is spun in a centrifuge or tested electronically to determine your hematocrit percentage.</p>

<h3>Why Plasma Centers Care</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your safety:</strong> Low hematocrit may indicate anemia - donating could make you feel worse</li>
<li><strong>Oxygen capacity:</strong> Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body</li>
<li><strong>Recovery ability:</strong> You need adequate red blood cells to recover from donation</li>
<li><strong>FDA requirements:</strong> Centers must follow federal guidelines for donor safety</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Hematocrit Requirements by Center</h2>

<h3>Standard Requirements</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Gender</th><th>Minimum HCT</th><th>Maximum HCT</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Females</td><td>38%</td><td>54%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Males</td><td>39%</td><td>54%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Center-Specific Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSL Plasma:</strong> Uses standard 38%/39% minimums</li>
<li><strong>BioLife:</strong> Uses standard 38%/39% minimums</li>
<li><strong>Grifols:</strong> Uses standard 38%/39% minimums</li>
<li><strong>Octapharma:</strong> Uses standard 38%/39% minimums</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Requirements are federally regulated, so variations between centers are minimal.</p>

<h3>What Your Number Means</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Range</th><th>What It Indicates</th><th>Can You Donate?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Below 38%</td><td>Possible anemia or iron deficiency</td><td>No - deferred</td></tr>
<tr><td>38-42%</td><td>Low-normal range</td><td>Yes, but monitor</td></tr>
<tr><td>42-48%</td><td>Optimal range</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>48-54%</td><td>High-normal range</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Above 54%</td><td>Too high - possible dehydration or other condition</td><td>No - deferred</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="too-low">What Happens If Your Hematocrit Is Too Low</h2>

<h3>The Deferral Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Staff will inform you that your hematocrit is below the minimum</li>
<li>You'll receive a temporary deferral</li>
<li>Most centers allow you to return in a few days to a week</li>
<li>If repeatedly low, they may recommend seeing a doctor</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Causes of Low Hematocrit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iron deficiency:</strong> Not getting enough iron in your diet</li>
<li><strong>Frequent donation:</strong> Not allowing enough time between donations</li>
<li><strong>Menstruation:</strong> Blood loss can temporarily lower levels</li>
<li><strong>Vegetarian/vegan diet:</strong> Plant iron is less easily absorbed</li>
<li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Can sometimes cause falsely low readings</li>
<li><strong>Underlying conditions:</strong> Anemia, thyroid issues, chronic disease</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="raise-levels">How to Raise Your Hematocrit</h2>

<h3>Dietary Changes (Most Effective)</h3>

<h4>Heme Iron (Best Absorbed)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red meat:</strong> Beef, lamb, venison - highest iron content</li>
<li><strong>Organ meats:</strong> Liver is extremely iron-rich</li>
<li><strong>Dark poultry:</strong> Chicken thighs and legs</li>
<li><strong>Seafood:</strong> Oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-Heme Iron (Plant Sources)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Lentils, black beans, chickpeas</li>
<li><strong>Leafy greens:</strong> Spinach, kale, Swiss chard</li>
<li><strong>Fortified cereals:</strong> Check labels for iron content</li>
<li><strong>Tofu:</strong> Especially iron-fortified varieties</li>
<li><strong>Pumpkin seeds:</strong> High in iron and portable snack</li>
</ul>

<h4>Absorption Boosters</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Dramatically improves iron absorption</li>
<li><strong>Citrus fruits:</strong> Orange juice with iron-rich meals</li>
<li><strong>Bell peppers:</strong> High in vitamin C</li>
<li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Cook with cast iron for bonus iron</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to Avoid Near Iron-Rich Meals</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Dairy, calcium supplements block iron absorption</li>
<li><strong>Coffee and tea:</strong> Tannins reduce iron uptake</li>
<li><strong>High-fiber foods:</strong> Can interfere with mineral absorption</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hydration Balance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay well hydrated:</strong> Dehydration can falsely elevate readings</li>
<li><strong>Don't overhydrate:</strong> Too much water can dilute blood</li>
<li><strong>Balance:</strong> 8-10 glasses of water daily is appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supplementation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iron supplements:</strong> Consider if diet alone isn't working (consult doctor first)</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Can help if your diet is already iron-rich</li>
<li><strong>Avoid without guidance:</strong> Too much iron can be harmful</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes That Cause Low Hematocrit</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Donating too frequently:</strong> Not giving body time to rebuild iron stores</li>
<li><strong>Relying on one iron-rich meal:</strong> Iron levels take time to build - consistency matters</li>
<li><strong>Drinking coffee with iron meals:</strong> Blocks absorption significantly</li>
<li><strong>Taking calcium with iron:</strong> They compete for absorption</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring menstrual cycle:</strong> Consider timing donations around your cycle</li>
<li><strong>Not tracking patterns:</strong> If you're frequently deferred, track what affects your levels</li>
<li><strong>Skipping the doctor:</strong> Chronic low hematocrit may indicate a treatable condition</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hematocrit vs Hemoglobin</h3>
<p>These tests are related but different:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Measurement</th><th>What It Measures</th><th>Normal Range</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Hematocrit (HCT)</td><td>% of blood that is red blood cells</td><td>38-54%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hemoglobin (Hgb)</td><td>Oxygen-carrying protein in red cells (g/dL)</td><td>12.5-18 g/dL</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Some centers test hematocrit, others test hemoglobin, and some test both. They both indicate your iron status.</p>

<!-- NEXT_STEPS_BLOCK_START -->
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps Based on Your Plasma Donation Estimate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Track visits:</strong> Log donation dates, bonuses, and pay to avoid missed incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare properly:</strong> Hydration and protein intake can reduce deferrals.</li>
<li><strong>Plan payouts:</strong> Understand prepaid cards, transfer delays, and fees.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is hematocrit and why do plasma centers test it?</h3>
<p>Hematocrit is the percentage of your blood that consists of red blood cells. Plasma centers test it to ensure you have enough red blood cells to safely donate. Low hematocrit indicates possible anemia and donating could be harmful to you.</p>

<h3>What is the minimum hematocrit level for plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers require a minimum hematocrit of 38% for women and 39% for men. The maximum is typically 54% for both. These ranges ensure donation is safe for you.</p>

<h3>How can I raise my hematocrit before plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Eat iron-rich foods like red meat, beans, and leafy greens. Pair iron foods with vitamin C for better absorption. Stay hydrated but don't overhydrate. Get adequate sleep. Consider iron supplements if your doctor recommends them.</p>

<h3>Why was my hematocrit too low to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Common causes include iron deficiency, frequent donation without adequate recovery, poor diet, dehydration, menstruation, or underlying health conditions. The center cannot let you donate if your levels are below the safe threshold.</p>

<h3>How long after low hematocrit deferral can I try again?</h3>
