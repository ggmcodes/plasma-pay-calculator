Some centers also accept a W-2 form for SSN verification. Bring all three - missing any one will result in being turned away."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does the first plasma donation take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your first visit takes 3-4 hours total. This includes registration/paperwork (30-45 min), a brief physical exam (15-20 min), health history questionnaire (15-20 min), and the actual donation (45-90 min depending on your weight). Subsequent visits are much faster, typically 90 minutes to 2 hours total."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I eat before my first plasma donation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Eat a high-protein, low-fat meal 2-3 hours before your appointment. Good options: eggs, chicken, lean turkey, Greek yogurt, or a protein shake. Avoid fatty foods (burgers, pizza, fried foods) as high fat content makes your plasma lipemic (milky/cloudy) and can result in your donation being rejected. Drink at least 16-32 oz of water."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get deferred on my first visit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Common first-visit deferrals include: low protein (under 6.0 g/dL), high or low blood pressure, low hematocrit (under 38%), recent tattoo or piercing (varies by state, 0-12 months), certain medications, and failing the health history questionnaire. About 10-15% of first-time donors are deferred for one or more reasons."}}]}

<h3>Save This Page</h3>
<p>Bookmark this page or screenshot the checklists below. This covers everything you need from the day before your first donation through the 24 hours after. Following this checklist <strong>dramatically reduces your chance of being deferred</strong> (turned away) on your first visit.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="documents">Documents Checklist</h2>

<p>Missing a single document means you go home without donating. Every center requires these three items. No exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>Required Documents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Government-issued photo ID</strong> (must be valid, not expired)
  <ul>
  <li>Driver's license</li>
  <li>State-issued ID card</li>
  <li>U.S. passport or passport card</li>
  <li>Military ID</li>
  <li>Note: Some centers do NOT accept foreign passports without a valid visa/work authorization</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Proof of current address</strong> (must match your ID or show current address within 30-60 days)
  <ul>
  <li>Utility bill (electric, gas, water, internet)</li>
  <li>Bank or credit card statement</li>
  <li>Lease agreement</li>
  <li>Vehicle registration</li>
  <li>Official mail from a government agency</li>
  <li>Note: Your ID counts as proof of address if the address is current</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Social Security number verification</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Social Security card (original, not a copy)</li>
  <li>W-2 form showing full SSN</li>
  <li>Some centers accept a pay stub with SSN</li>
  <li>Note: ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) is accepted at some centers</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-radius: 12px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border: 1px solid #fbbf24;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #92400e;">Pre-Registration Tip</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Most centers offer online pre-registration. Complete this before your visit to save 15-30 minutes. Search "[center name] new donor registration" and fill out the online forms. You will still need physical documents at the center, but the paperwork will be partially done.</p>

    </ul>
</section>

<h2 id="day-before">Day-Before Checklist (24 Hours Out)</h2>

<p>What you do the day before directly determines whether you pass screening. This is not optional prep; it is essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Drink 80-100 oz of water throughout the day.</strong> This is more than most people normally drink. Space it out. Do not try to chug it all at once. Well-hydrated veins are easier to access and your donation flows faster.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Eat high-protein meals.</strong> Your protein level must be at least 6.0 g/dL to donate. Eat chicken, fish, eggs, beans, Greek yogurt, or other protein-rich foods at every meal. A single high-protein meal is not enough; you need a full day of good nutrition.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Avoid fatty foods.</strong> Skip the pizza, burgers, fried chicken, and ice cream. High-fat meals cause lipemia (fatty plasma) that can result in your donation being discarded and you being temporarily deferred. Stick to lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Avoid alcohol.</strong> Alcohol dehydrates you and can affect your blood pressure reading. No drinking for at least 24 hours before donation.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Get 7-8 hours of sleep.</strong> Being well-rested helps maintain stable vital signs during screening.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Avoid strenuous exercise.</strong> Heavy workouts can affect your hematocrit and blood pressure readings the next day. Light activity is fine.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Gather your documents.</strong> Lay out your photo ID, proof of address, and Social Security card so you do not forget them in the morning.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Look up your center's hours and plan your arrival.</strong> Weekday mornings typically have the shortest wait times. Avoid Saturday afternoons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="morning-of">Morning-Of Checklist (2-3 Hours Before)</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Eat a high-protein, low-fat breakfast.</strong> Best options: eggs (scrambled, boiled), oatmeal with protein powder, Greek yogurt with berries, whole wheat toast with peanut butter, or a lean protein shake. Eat 2-3 hours before your appointment, not right before.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Drink 16-32 oz of water</strong> with your breakfast. Continue sipping water until you leave.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Take your regular medications</strong> (note: some medications may defer you; call the center ahead if you are unsure about a specific medication).</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Avoid caffeine excess.</strong> One cup of coffee is fine, but limit it. Excessive caffeine raises blood pressure and heart rate, which can cause a deferral at screening.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Shower.</strong> Centers check your arms for skin conditions, rashes, and track marks. Clean skin makes a good impression and reduces infection risk.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Wear a short-sleeved shirt</strong> or a top with sleeves that easily push above the elbow. Layer with a hoodie for warmth.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Double-check your documents bag.</strong> Photo ID, proof of address, Social Security card.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-bring">What to Bring Bag</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>All three documents</strong> (ID, proof of address, SSN)</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Phone + charging cable or portable charger.</strong> Your first visit takes 3-4 hours. Your phone battery will not survive.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Headphones/earbuds.</strong> Centers are noisy with machines beeping and people talking.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Water bottle (filled).</strong> Continue hydrating while waiting and during donation.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Snack for after.</strong> A protein bar, trail mix, or fruit for immediate post-donation recovery.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Blanket or warm layer.</strong> Centers are cold (65-70 degrees F). You will thank yourself.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Entertainment.</strong> Book, tablet, downloaded shows/podcasts. You will have downtime.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>List of medications.</strong> You will need to provide names and dosages during the health screening.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step: What Happens at Your First Visit</h2>

<p>Here is exactly what to expect so nothing catches you off guard:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Check-In and Registration (15-30 minutes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; Present your three documents at the front desk</li>
<li>&#9744; Staff will scan or copy your documents</li>
<li>&#9744; You will create a donor account (or complete online pre-registration if you did it beforehand)</li>
<li>&#9744; You will have your photo taken for your donor file</li>
<li>&#9744; You may receive a new donor orientation video to watch</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Health History Questionnaire (15-20 minutes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; Complete a detailed health questionnaire, usually on a touchscreen kiosk</li>
<li>&#9744; Questions cover travel history, sexual history, drug use, medications, medical conditions, and recent tattoos/piercings</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Be honest.</strong> These questions are FDA-mandated for safety. Dishonest answers can result in permanent deferral if discovered, and can compromise the safety of the plasma supply</li>
<li>&#9744; Some questions may feel intrusive (especially regarding sexual history), but they are asked of every donor at every visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Physical Exam (15-20 minutes, first visit only)</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; A medical professional (physician, PA, or NP) performs a brief physical</li>
<li>&#9744; They check your arms for visible veins, track marks, rashes, or skin conditions</li>
<li>&#9744; Height and weight measurement (you must weigh at least 110 lbs)</li>
<li>&#9744; Brief medical history review</li>
<li>&#9744; You sign consent forms acknowledging the risks of donation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screening">Step 4: Screening (10-15 minutes, done every visit)</h2>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Blood pressure:</strong> Must be between 90/50 and 180/100 mmHg. If you are nervous, take deep breaths. Sit quietly for 5 minutes before the reading. If your first reading is borderline, they typically allow a re-check.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Pulse:</strong> Must be between 50-100 beats per minute</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Temperature:</strong> Must be below 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C)</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Finger stick blood test:</strong> A small prick to test protein level (must be at least 6.0 g/dL) and hematocrit (must be at least 38% for women, 39% for men). This is where good hydration and protein intake the day before pays off.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Weight check:</strong> Determines the volume of plasma collected (more weight = more volume = potentially higher pay)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="during-donation">Step 5: The Donation (45-90 minutes)</h2>
<ul>
<li>&#9744; You will be seated in a reclining chair, similar to a dentist chair</li>
<li>&#9744; A phlebotomist cleans your inner elbow area with iodine (this stains skin and fabric orange)</li>
<li>&#9744; A 16-gauge needle is inserted into a vein. This is larger than a standard blood draw needle. Expect a sharp pinch followed by pressure. The initial stick is the most uncomfortable part.</li>
<li>&#9744; The plasmapheresis machine draws blood, separates plasma, and returns red blood cells and saline to you in cycles. You will feel alternating pressure as the machine draws and returns.</li>
<li>&#9744; During return cycles, you may feel coolness as room-temperature saline enters your bloodstream, and a tingling sensation in your lips or fingers from the anticoagulant (citrate). This is normal.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Keep your donation arm still.</strong> Use your other hand for your phone, water, and snacks.</li>
<li>&#9744; Alert staff if you feel: dizzy, nauseous, have sharp pain at the needle site, numbness in your hand, or see swelling around the needle.</li>
<li>&#9744; First-time donors often have shorter collection volumes, so your first donation may be quicker than subsequent ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="after-donation">After-Donation Care Checklist</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Hold firm pressure on the puncture site</strong> for at least 10 minutes. Do not peek. Do not bend your arm.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Keep your bandage on for 4-6 hours.</strong> Do not remove it early.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Eat your snack</strong> before leaving the center or within 15 minutes of finishing.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Drink 16-32 oz of water</strong> within the first hour after donation.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Sit in your car for 5-10 minutes</strong> before driving. Some donors feel lightheaded immediately after donation, especially the first time.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>No heavy lifting with the donation arm</strong> for 6-8 hours.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>No strenuous exercise</strong> for 12-24 hours.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Avoid alcohol</strong> for at least 4-6 hours after donation.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Continue drinking extra water</strong> for the rest of the day. Your body needs to replace the fluid volume you donated.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Eat a high-protein dinner.</strong> Your body needs to start replacing the plasma proteins you donated. Focus on lean meats, eggs, fish, beans, and dairy.</li>
<li>&#9744; <strong>Note your pay.</strong> Check your payment card to confirm you received the correct amount. If it is your first visit, you should receive the new donor rate, which is typically higher than the regular rate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-deferrals">Common First-Visit Deferrals (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>

<p>About 10-15% of first-time donors are deferred. Here are the most common reasons and how to prevent them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low protein (below 6.0 g/dL):</strong> Caused by inadequate protein intake. <em>Prevention: Eat 60-80g of protein the day before.</em></li>
<li><strong>Low hematocrit (below 38%):</strong> Common in women and donors with low iron. <em>Prevention: Eat iron-rich foods (red meat, spinach, fortified cereals) for several days before. Consider an iron supplement if you plan to donate regularly.</em></li>
<li><strong>High blood pressure (above 180/100):</strong> Often caused by anxiety, caffeine, or uncontrolled hypertension. <em>Prevention: Limit caffeine, arrive early and sit quietly, practice deep breathing.</em></li>
<li><strong>Recent tattoo or piercing:</strong> Varies by state: some states have no wait, others require up to 12 months. <em>Prevention: Check your state's specific rule before going.</em></li>
<li><strong>Medications:</strong> Certain medications cause temporary or permanent deferral (Accutane, blood thinners, certain antibiotics). <em>Prevention: Call the center before your visit with a list of your medications.</em></li>
<li><strong>Weight under 110 lbs:</strong> FDA minimum. No way around this one.</li>
<li><strong>Visible vein issues:</strong> The phlebotomist needs to be able to see or feel an adequate vein. <em>Prevention: Hydrate aggressively and warm your arms before the screening.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are deferred on your first visit, do not give up. Many deferrals are temporary. Ask the staff specifically what you need to do differently and when you can return.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I have never donated blood before?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. No prior blood donation experience is required. Many plasma donors have never donated blood. The first-visit physical exam and screening process is designed specifically to evaluate new donors with no prior experience.</p>

<h3>What if I am afraid of needles?</h3>
<p>This is more common than you think. Tell the phlebotomist you are nervous. They deal with this daily and know techniques to minimize discomfort. Look away during the needle insertion. Bring headphones and a podcast or show to distract yourself. Many needle-phobic donors report that the anticipation is worse than the actual stick. The initial pinch lasts about 2-3 seconds.</p>

<h3>How much does the first visit pay?</h3>
<p>New donor pay is significantly higher than regular rates. Most centers offer $75-$125 for your first donation, with escalating bonuses through your first 6-10 visits. Some centers advertise totals like "$1,000 in your first month" or "$100 per visit for new donors." These are real offers, but they are promotional rates that decrease after the new donor period ends.</p>

<h3>Can I eat during donation?</h3>
<p>Yes. In fact, it is encouraged. Most centers allow you to eat snacks and drink water during donation. Just use your non-donation hand. Granola bars, crackers, and fruit are popular choices. Avoid anything messy or crumbly since you are lying in a reclined chair.</p>

<h3>What happens to my plasma after donation?</h3>
<p>Your plasma is frozen and shipped to a fractionation facility where it is processed into pharmaceutical products including immunoglobulin (for immune deficiency patients), albumin (for burn and surgical patients), and clotting factors (for hemophilia patients). These are life-saving medications that cannot be manufactured synthetically. Every donation matters.</p>
