    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #065f46; font-size: 1.3rem;">Quick Answer</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Nausea and dizziness during plasma donation are usually caused by citrate reaction, low blood sugar, dehydration, anxiety, or a vasovagal response.</strong> These symptoms are common and typically mild. Immediate steps: tell staff right away, squeeze a stress ball, breathe deeply, and request a cold compress. Prevention is key — eat a meal 2-3 hours before, hydrate for 24 hours beforehand, and never donate on an empty stomach.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="causes">What Causes Nausea and Dizziness During Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Several factors can trigger nausea and dizziness during or after plasma donation. Understanding the cause helps you prevent and manage symptoms:</p>

<h3>1. Citrate Reaction (Most Common Cause)</h3>
<p>During plasmapheresis, an anticoagulant called <strong>sodium citrate</strong> is mixed with your blood to prevent clotting inside the machine. When citrate-treated blood is returned to your body, it temporarily binds calcium in your bloodstream, causing a condition called <strong>hypocalcemia</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Tingling or numbness around lips, tongue, fingers, or toes; metallic taste in mouth; nausea; dizziness; muscle cramps or twitching</li>
    <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Mild in most donors (70-80% of nausea cases during donation are citrate-related)</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Resolves within 10-30 minutes after donation ends as calcium levels normalize</li>
    <li><strong>Why some people are more affected:</strong> Smaller body size, faster return rate, lower baseline calcium levels, or donating frequently</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)</h3>
<p>Donating plasma on an empty stomach or with inadequate food intake is a leading cause of nausea and lightheadedness.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Nausea, shakiness, cold sweats, lightheadedness, weakness, irritability</li>
    <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The body uses glucose to maintain blood pressure and organ function during the stress of donation. Without adequate fuel, blood sugar drops and symptoms appear.</li>
    <li><strong>Most at-risk:</strong> Donors who skip meals, donate first thing in the morning without eating, or have diabetes</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Dehydration</h3>
<p>Plasma is approximately 90% water. When your body is already dehydrated and then loses additional fluid through donation, blood volume drops significantly.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dizziness, nausea, fatigue, headache, dark urine, dry mouth</li>
    <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Lower blood volume means lower blood pressure, which reduces blood flow to the brain</li>
    <li><strong>Compounding factors:</strong> Caffeine, alcohol, exercise before donation, or hot weather all worsen dehydration</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Anxiety and Stress Response</h3>
<p>Nervousness about needles, the medical environment, or the donation process can trigger physical symptoms that mimic — or worsen — other causes of nausea.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Nausea, stomach upset, rapid heartbeat, sweating, dizziness, feeling of dread</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Stress hormones (adrenaline, cortisol) affect gut motility and blood pressure, creating a feedback loop of physical symptoms and anxiety</li>
    <li><strong>Most at-risk:</strong> First-time donors, needle-phobic individuals, people with generalized anxiety</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Vasovagal Response</h3>
<p>A vasovagal reaction is your nervous system overreacting to a trigger, causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. It is the same mechanism that causes full fainting (syncope), but milder cases produce nausea and dizziness without complete loss of consciousness.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Sudden nausea, warmth, sweating, tunnel vision, lightheadedness, paleness</li>
    <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Seeing blood or the needle, pain, sitting still for too long, overheating</li>
    <li><strong>Key difference:</strong> Vasovagal symptoms come on suddenly and feel like a "wave," whereas citrate and dehydration symptoms build gradually</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="immediate-solutions">Immediate Solutions When You Feel Nauseous or Dizzy</h2>

<p>If you start feeling nauseous or dizzy during your donation, take these steps immediately:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Tell Staff Right Away</h3>
<p><strong>This is the most important step.</strong> Do not try to tough it out. Staff can adjust the machine settings, slow down the return rate (which reduces citrate delivery), and monitor you closely. Early intervention prevents mild symptoms from becoming severe.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Squeeze a Stress Ball</h3>
<p>Rhythmically squeezing a stress ball or clenching and releasing your fists activates skeletal muscle pumps that help maintain blood pressure. Most centers provide stress balls — if yours does not, ask for one or bring your own.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Tense Your Leg Muscles</h3>
<p>Cross your legs and squeeze your thighs together for 10-15 seconds, then release. Repeat every 30 seconds. This drives pooled blood back toward your heart and brain, countering the drop in blood pressure that causes dizziness.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Practice Deep Breathing</h3>
<p>Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale through your mouth for 6 counts. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system and calms the vasovagal response. Avoid rapid shallow breathing (hyperventilation), which worsens symptoms.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Request a Cold Compress</h3>
<p>A cold cloth on your forehead or the back of your neck stimulates alertness and constricts blood vessels, helping to raise blood pressure. Ask staff for a cold compress — this is a standard intervention they have readily available.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Eat Calcium-Rich Snacks (for Citrate Reactions)</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a citrate reaction (tingling, metallic taste), eating Tums or calcium chews can help neutralize the effect. Some donors bring calcium supplements to chew during donation. Ask staff if they have antacid tablets available.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Sip Juice or Eat Snacks</h3>
<p>If low blood sugar is suspected, staff will provide juice, crackers, or glucose tablets. The sugar enters your bloodstream within 5-10 minutes and can quickly resolve hypoglycemia-related nausea.</p>

<h2 id="prevention">How to Prevent Nausea and Dizziness</h2>

<h3>24 Hours Before Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hydrate consistently:</strong> Drink 64-80 oz of water throughout the day. Adequate hydration the day before is more important than chugging water right before your appointment.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid alcohol:</strong> Alcohol is a diuretic that dehydrates you and can lower blood pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Eat balanced meals:</strong> Include protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats at every meal. Your body needs fuel reserves for donation.</li>
    <li><strong>Get adequate sleep:</strong> Fatigue amplifies every trigger for nausea and dizziness. Aim for 7+ hours.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2-3 Hours Before Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eat a substantial meal:</strong> Include at least 20-30g protein (chicken, eggs, protein shake), complex carbs (whole grain bread, brown rice), and healthy fats (avocado, nuts). Never donate on an empty stomach.</li>
    <li><strong>Drink 16-32 oz of water:</strong> Top off your hydration before arriving.</li>
    <li><strong>Take calcium:</strong> Eating a Tums or calcium supplement before donation can preemptively reduce citrate reaction symptoms.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid excessive caffeine:</strong> A small amount is fine, but too much dehydrates you and raises anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Keep squeezing:</strong> Use a stress ball in the donation arm and tense leg muscles periodically throughout the entire session</li>
    <li><strong>Stay distracted:</strong> Watch a show, listen to music or a podcast, or chat with staff. Focusing on bodily sensations increases symptom awareness and anxiety.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay warm:</strong> If the center is cold, bring a blanket or ask for one. Cold environments can worsen nausea.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not look at the machine or needle:</strong> Visual triggers can amplify both anxiety-based and vasovagal nausea.</li>
    <li><strong>Sip water if allowed:</strong> Some centers allow you to drink water during donation. Ask if this is permitted at yours.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stay seated 10-15 minutes:</strong> Eat and drink at the canteen before standing</li>
    <li><strong>Stand up slowly:</strong> Rise gradually to avoid orthostatic dizziness</li>
    <li><strong>Drink 16-32 oz of water or juice:</strong> Replenish lost fluids immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Eat a snack or meal:</strong> Restore blood sugar with something substantial within 30 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid hot showers for 2 hours:</strong> Heat dilates blood vessels and can cause delayed dizziness</li>
    <li><strong>Skip heavy exercise for 4-6 hours:</strong> Your body needs time to recover fluid volume</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="serious-vs-normal">When Nausea Is Serious vs Normal</h2>

<p>Most nausea and dizziness during plasma donation is completely benign and resolves within 30 minutes. However, some symptoms indicate a more serious issue that requires immediate medical attention:</p>

<h3>Normal (Not a Cause for Concern)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mild lightheadedness that improves with lying down</li>
    <li>Brief nausea that resolves with juice and crackers</li>
    <li>Tingling in lips or fingers from citrate (resolves within 10-30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Temporary paleness or clammy skin</li>
    <li>Mild headache after donation</li>
    <li>Feeling tired or weak for 1-2 hours post-donation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potentially Serious (Seek Medical Help)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Severe chest pain or tightness:</strong> Could indicate a cardiac event — tell staff immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath:</strong> May indicate a serious reaction to citrate or an allergic response</li>
    <li><strong>Prolonged loss of consciousness (more than 2 minutes):</strong> Requires emergency evaluation</li>
    <li><strong>Severe muscle spasms or cramping:</strong> Could indicate dangerous calcium depletion from citrate</li>
    <li><strong>Vomiting that does not stop:</strong> Persistent vomiting may indicate a more serious systemic reaction</li>
    <li><strong>Symptoms lasting more than 2 hours after donation:</strong> Nausea or dizziness that does not resolve warrants medical evaluation</li>
    <li><strong>Numbness or weakness on one side of the body:</strong> May indicate a neurological event — seek emergency care</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When in doubt, tell staff and let them evaluate you.</strong> Plasma center staff are trained to distinguish between normal and abnormal reactions. It is always better to speak up than to silently endure worsening symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Why do I feel nauseous during plasma donation?</h3>
<p>The most common cause is a <strong>citrate reaction</strong> — the anticoagulant used in the machine temporarily lowers calcium in your blood, causing nausea, tingling, and dizziness. Other common causes include low blood sugar from not eating, dehydration from inadequate fluid intake, anxiety, and vasovagal response. Eating a meal 2-3 hours before and hydrating well for 24 hours before your appointment significantly reduces nausea risk.</p>

<h3>How do I stop dizziness during plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Tell staff immediately so they can slow the machine. Then: squeeze a stress ball, tense and relax your leg muscles every 30 seconds, practice slow deep breathing (4 counts in, 4 counts hold, 6 counts out), and request a cold compress for your forehead. These techniques help raise blood pressure and counteract the vasovagal response that causes dizziness.</p>

<h3>Is it normal to feel sick after donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Mild nausea, dizziness, fatigue, or lightheadedness for 30-60 minutes after donation is normal and affects about 10-15% of donors. These symptoms should improve with rest, fluids, and a snack. If symptoms persist for more than 2 hours, are severe, or include chest pain, difficulty breathing, or prolonged vomiting, seek medical attention.</p>

<h3>Can I take Tums before plasma donation to prevent nausea?</h3>
<p>Yes. Taking 1-2 Tums (calcium carbonate) before or during donation can help prevent citrate-related nausea by supplementing your calcium levels. Some experienced donors eat Tums proactively at every visit. You can also bring calcium chews or drink calcium-fortified orange juice before your appointment.</p>

<h3>Should I stop donating plasma if I always feel nauseous?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. First, try improving your preparation: eat a larger meal, hydrate more aggressively, take calcium supplements, and ask staff to slow the citrate return rate. If you consistently feel nauseous despite proper preparation, consider reducing donation frequency to once per week. If severe nausea persists, consult your doctor — you may have an underlying sensitivity to citrate or other factors that make frequent donation inadvisable for you.</p>
