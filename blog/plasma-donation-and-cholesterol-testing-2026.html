<div class="quick-answer" style="background: #f0fdf4; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #065f46; font-size: 1.3rem;">Quick Answer</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Plasma centers do not directly test your cholesterol level.</strong> However, they do check total protein levels and visually inspect your plasma for lipemia (a milky, opaque appearance caused by high fat content in the blood). Having high cholesterol does not disqualify you from donating plasma. Statin medications (Lipitor, Crestor, etc.) are allowed at all major plasma centers. The main risk for high-cholesterol donors is lipemic plasma -- if you eat a high-fat meal before donating, your plasma may appear milky and be rejected, wasting your time. Eat a lean, protein-rich meal 2-3 hours before your appointment to avoid this.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="cholesterol-screening">Do Plasma Centers Test Your Cholesterol?</h2>

<p>This is one of the most common questions from donors who have been diagnosed with high cholesterol or take cholesterol medication. The short answer is no -- plasma centers do not run a cholesterol panel (LDL, HDL, triglycerides) as part of their standard screening.</p>

<h3>What Plasma Centers Actually Test</h3>
<p>At every donation visit, plasma centers check the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total protein:</strong> Your blood is tested for total protein content (must be at least 6.0 g/dL). This is related to cholesterol in that both are carried by lipoproteins, but it is not a cholesterol test</li>
    <li><strong>Hematocrit:</strong> The percentage of your blood volume that is red blood cells (must be at least 38% for women, 39% for men)</li>
    <li><strong>Blood pressure:</strong> Must be within acceptable range (typically below 180/100)</li>
    <li><strong>Pulse:</strong> Heart rate check (typically 50-100 bpm)</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Must be below 99.5 F</li>
    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Must be at least 110 lbs</li>
    <li><strong>Visual plasma inspection:</strong> After your plasma is collected, it is visually inspected for color and clarity. This is where cholesterol-related issues can surface (see lipemia section below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What They Do NOT Test</h3>
<ul>
    <li>LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol)</li>
    <li>HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol)</li>
    <li>Triglycerides</li>
    <li>Total cholesterol number</li>
    <li>A1C or blood sugar</li>
    <li>Liver function panels</li>
</ul>

<p>Plasma centers are not your doctor's office. Their screening is designed to ensure you are healthy enough to donate safely and that your plasma is usable for manufacturing -- not to provide a comprehensive health assessment.</p>

<h2 id="protein-lipemia">Total Protein and Lipemia: The Cholesterol Connection</h2>

<p>While plasma centers do not test cholesterol directly, two of their standard checks are indirectly related to cholesterol and fat levels in your blood:</p>

<h3>Total Protein Test</h3>
<p>The total protein test measures all proteins in your blood, including albumin and globulins. This test is related to cholesterol because:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lipoproteins carry cholesterol:</strong> LDL and HDL are lipoproteins (fat + protein complexes) that transport cholesterol through your bloodstream. Very high or very low lipoprotein levels can affect total protein readings</li>
    <li><strong>Dehydration effect:</strong> Dehydration concentrates all blood components, including both proteins and cholesterol. If your total protein is high, your cholesterol is likely concentrated too</li>
    <li><strong>Nutritional status:</strong> Both total protein and cholesterol levels reflect your overall nutritional status. Poor diet affects both measurements</li>
</ul>

<p>The total protein test is not a substitute for a cholesterol panel. It will not tell you your LDL number or your heart disease risk. But it does provide a general indicator of your blood's protein and lipoprotein composition.</p>

<h3>Visual Lipemia Check</h3>
<p>After your plasma is collected, it is visually inspected. Normal plasma is clear and straw-yellow in color. Lipemic plasma appears milky, opaque, or cloudy -- and this is directly related to fat (and indirectly cholesterol) in your blood. More on this in the section below.</p>

<h2 id="high-cholesterol">High Cholesterol Does NOT Disqualify You</h2>

<p>If you have been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you can still donate plasma. Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h3>Why High Cholesterol Is Not a Deferral</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No cholesterol threshold exists:</strong> Plasma centers do not have a maximum cholesterol level for donors because they do not test for it. There is no number that will get you turned away</li>
    <li><strong>Cholesterol does not affect plasma quality:</strong> The pharmaceutical companies that buy plasma for manufacturing are interested in the antibodies and proteins in your plasma, not your cholesterol content. Your plasma is equally useful whether your cholesterol is 180 or 280</li>
    <li><strong>FDA guidelines do not exclude:</strong> The FDA's donor eligibility guidelines do not list high cholesterol as a deferral condition. High cholesterol is a cardiovascular risk factor for you personally, but it does not make your plasma unsuitable for use</li>
    <li><strong>Millions of donors have high cholesterol:</strong> Given that nearly 40% of American adults have high cholesterol, plasma centers would lose a massive portion of their donor base if they excluded these donors</li>
</ul>

<h3>When High Cholesterol Could Cause Issues</h3>
<p>While high cholesterol itself is not a problem, related conditions might be:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uncontrolled blood pressure:</strong> High cholesterol often accompanies high blood pressure. If your blood pressure exceeds the center's limits (typically 180/100), you will be deferred until it is controlled</li>
    <li><strong>Recent heart attack or stroke:</strong> If high cholesterol has led to a cardiovascular event, you may be deferred for a period (usually 6-12 months) while you recover</li>
    <li><strong>Lipemic plasma:</strong> If your cholesterol is very high AND you eat a fatty meal before donating, the resulting lipemic plasma may be rejected (see next section)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lipemic-plasma">Lipemic Plasma: Why It Gets Rejected</h2>

<p>Lipemic plasma is the most common cholesterol-related issue that plasma donors encounter. Understanding what it is and how to prevent it will save you from wasted trips to the center.</p>

<h3>What Is Lipemic Plasma?</h3>
<p>Lipemic plasma is plasma that appears milky, opaque, or cloudy instead of the normal clear straw-yellow color. This milky appearance is caused by high levels of triglycerides and other fats circulating in your blood, which make the plasma too cloudy to use.</p>

<h3>Why It Gets Rejected</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Manufacturing interference:</strong> Lipemic plasma interferes with the fractionation process used to extract therapeutic proteins. The fat particles clog filters and reduce the quality of the final pharmaceutical product</li>
    <li><strong>Testing interference:</strong> The cloudiness of lipemic plasma makes it difficult to run accurate viral safety tests. Since every plasma unit must be tested for HIV, hepatitis, and other infections, untestable plasma cannot be used</li>
    <li><strong>Visual quality standard:</strong> Plasma collection facilities have visual quality standards. Plasma that does not meet these standards is discarded regardless of the reason</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Happens If Your Plasma Is Lipemic</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>You still get paid:</strong> At most centers, you are compensated for your time even if your plasma is rejected for lipemia. The donation process is completed normally -- the plasma is simply discarded after collection rather than being sent for manufacturing</li>
    <li><strong>No deferral:</strong> Lipemic plasma does not result in a deferral. You can return for your next scheduled donation. However, repeated lipemic donations may trigger a conversation with center medical staff about your diet</li>
    <li><strong>Time wasted:</strong> Even though you get paid, repeated lipemic samples waste your time and the center's resources. Preventing lipemia through diet is much better for everyone</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Prevent Lipemic Plasma</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Avoid high-fat meals 24 hours before donating:</strong> This is the single most effective prevention strategy. Skip the pizza, burgers, fried food, and heavy cream sauces the day before and the day of your donation</li>
    <li><strong>Eat lean protein instead:</strong> Chicken breast, turkey, fish, egg whites, beans, and low-fat dairy are excellent pre-donation meals that maintain your protein levels without adding excess fat</li>
    <li><strong>Skip fast food the day of:</strong> Fast food meals are almost universally high in fat. If you need a quick meal before donating, choose a grilled chicken sandwich (no mayo), a turkey sub, or a protein bar</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid alcohol 24-48 hours before:</strong> Alcohol temporarily raises triglyceride levels, increasing the risk of lipemic plasma</li>
    <li><strong>Morning appointments may help:</strong> Fasting overnight naturally lowers triglyceride levels. An early morning donation after an overnight fast (followed by a lean breakfast after donating) reduces lipemia risk</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="statins-allowed">Statin Medications Are Allowed for Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>If you take statin medications (the most commonly prescribed drugs for high cholesterol), you can still donate plasma. This is one of the most frequently asked questions, and the answer is clear:</p>

<h3>Approved Statin Medications</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Generic Name</th><th>Brand Name</th><th>Can You Donate?</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Atorvastatin</td><td>Lipitor</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Rosuvastatin</td><td>Crestor</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Simvastatin</td><td>Zocor</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pravastatin</td><td>Pravachol</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lovastatin</td><td>Mevacor, Altoprev</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fluvastatin</td><td>Lescol</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pitavastatin</td><td>Livalo, Zypitamag</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why Statins Are Allowed</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statins do not affect plasma quality:</strong> Statin medications work by inhibiting cholesterol production in your liver. They do not alter the antibodies, immunoglobulins, or clotting factors that plasma is collected for</li>
    <li><strong>Statins are not immunosuppressants:</strong> Unlike some medications that are deferred (like immunosuppressants or blood thinners), statins do not compromise your immune system or affect your blood's ability to clot</li>
    <li><strong>Statins indicate managed health:</strong> Taking statins means you are actively managing your cholesterol under a doctor's care. This is viewed positively -- you are a health-conscious donor who monitors and treats medical conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Cholesterol Medications</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ezetimibe (Zetia):</strong> Allowed for plasma donation</li>
    <li><strong>PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent):</strong> Generally allowed, but disclose during screening as these are injectable medications</li>
    <li><strong>Bile acid sequestrants (Questran, Colestid):</strong> Generally allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Fibrates (Tricor, Lopid):</strong> Generally allowed -- disclose during screening</li>
    <li><strong>Niacin (prescription dose):</strong> Generally allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Fish oil supplements:</strong> Allowed (these are supplements, not prescription medications)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Always disclose all medications during your health screening.</strong> Even though statins and most cholesterol medications are allowed, the center's medical staff needs a complete picture of your health to ensure safe donation.</p>

<h2 id="diet-tips">Diet Tips for Cholesterol-Conscious Plasma Donors</h2>

<p>If you are managing high cholesterol and donating plasma regularly, your diet serves double duty: keeping your cholesterol in check AND ensuring high-quality plasma donations. Here are strategies that accomplish both:</p>

<h3>Best Pre-Donation Meals for High-Cholesterol Donors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Grilled chicken breast with vegetables:</strong> High protein, low fat, no cholesterol concerns. The ideal pre-donation meal</li>
    <li><strong>Oatmeal with berries:</strong> Oats contain soluble fiber that actively lowers LDL cholesterol. A great breakfast before a morning donation</li>
    <li><strong>Turkey and avocado wrap:</strong> Lean protein with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats that do not cause lipemia</li>
    <li><strong>Greek yogurt with nuts:</strong> High in protein, moderate in healthy fats, and filling. Choose low-fat or non-fat yogurt</li>
    <li><strong>Bean and vegetable soup:</strong> High in protein and fiber, very low in fat. Also provides hydration</li>
    <li><strong>Salmon or tuna:</strong> Omega-3 fatty acids actually improve cholesterol ratios. Fish is an excellent pre-donation protein source</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meals to Avoid Before Donating</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pizza:</strong> High in saturated fat from cheese and processed meats. One of the most common causes of lipemic plasma</li>
    <li><strong>Burgers and fries:</strong> Red meat plus fried food is a double dose of saturated fat</li>
    <li><strong>Fried chicken or wings:</strong> Frying adds enormous amounts of fat to an otherwise good protein source</li>
    <li><strong>Ice cream or milkshakes:</strong> High in saturated fat and sugar</li>
    <li><strong>Bacon and sausage breakfast:</strong> Processed meats are very high in saturated fat</li>
    <li><strong>Cream-based pasta dishes:</strong> Alfredo sauce, mac and cheese, and cream soups are high in fat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do plasma centers test your cholesterol?</h3>
<p>No. Plasma centers do not run a cholesterol panel (LDL, HDL, triglycerides, or total cholesterol). They test total protein, hematocrit, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight. They also visually inspect your plasma for lipemia (cloudiness from high fat), which is indirectly related to fat and cholesterol in your blood, but it is not a cholesterol test.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I have high cholesterol?</h3>
<p>Yes. High cholesterol is not a deferral condition at any major plasma center. The FDA does not list high cholesterol as a reason to exclude donors. Your plasma is equally valuable regardless of your cholesterol level. The only cholesterol-related risk is lipemic (milky) plasma from eating a high-fat meal before donating.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma while taking Lipitor or other statins?</h3>
<p>Yes. All statin medications (Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor, Pravachol, etc.) are allowed for plasma donation. Statins do not affect the antibodies or proteins that plasma is collected for. Always disclose your medications during screening, but statins will not disqualify you.</p>

<h3>What is lipemic plasma and how do I prevent it?</h3>
<p>Lipemic plasma is plasma that appears milky or cloudy instead of clear yellow, caused by high levels of fat (triglycerides) in your blood. It is usually caused by eating a high-fat meal before donating. Prevent it by eating lean, protein-rich meals (grilled chicken, fish, beans) and avoiding fried food, pizza, burgers, and heavy cream sauces for 24 hours before your appointment.</p>

<h3>Will my plasma be rejected if I have high cholesterol?</h3>
<p>Not because of your cholesterol diagnosis itself. However, if you eat a high-fat meal before donating and your plasma appears lipemic (milky), it may be rejected for manufacturing. You will still get paid in most cases, but the plasma is discarded. To prevent this, eat a lean meal before donating and avoid fatty foods for 24 hours prior.</p>
