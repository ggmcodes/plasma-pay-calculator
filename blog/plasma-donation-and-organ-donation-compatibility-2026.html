    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #065f46; font-size: 1.3rem;">Quick Answer</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Being on the organ donor registry does NOT affect your ability to donate plasma -- you can absolutely do both.</strong> However, if you have received an organ transplant (kidney, liver, heart, lung, etc.), you are almost always permanently deferred from plasma donation. The reason is not the transplant itself -- it is the lifelong immunosuppressant medications required to prevent organ rejection. These drugs alter your immune system and disqualify your plasma from being used in medical products. Living organ donors (people who donated a kidney or part of their liver) may be eligible after a recovery period if they are no longer on any disqualifying medications.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="organ-donor-registry">On the Organ Donor Registry? You Can Absolutely Donate Plasma</h2>

<p>This is one of the most common misconceptions about plasma donation. Many people believe that being registered as an organ donor somehow conflicts with plasma donation. It does not.</p>

<h3>Why There Is No Conflict</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Different systems entirely:</strong> The organ donor registry is a record of your wishes for after death. Plasma donation is an activity you do while alive. These two systems do not interact in any way</li>
    <li><strong>No shared databases:</strong> Plasma centers do not access or check the organ donor registry. Your registry status is not part of the health screening process and will never come up during your plasma donation appointment</li>
    <li><strong>No physical impact:</strong> Being on the organ donor registry does not change anything about your body, your blood, or your plasma. It is simply a legal declaration of your wishes regarding posthumous organ donation</li>
    <li><strong>You can be on multiple registries:</strong> You can simultaneously be on the organ donor registry, donate plasma twice a week, donate whole blood every 56 days, and be on the bone marrow registry. None of these conflict with each other</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Myths Debunked</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Myth</th><th>Reality</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>"If I donate plasma, my organs will not be viable for transplant"</td><td>False. Plasma regenerates within 24-48 hours. Regular plasma donation has no impact on organ viability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"Plasma centers will not accept me if I am an organ donor"</td><td>False. Organ donor registry status is never checked and does not affect eligibility</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"Donating plasma weakens my organs"</td><td>False. Plasma donation removes fluid and proteins that your body replenishes quickly. It does not damage organs</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"I have to choose between organ donation and plasma donation"</td><td>False. You can do both. They serve different purposes and operate through completely different systems</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you are on the organ donor registry and wondering whether you can donate plasma, the answer is an unequivocal yes. Your organ donor status has zero bearing on plasma donation eligibility.</p>

<h2 id="after-organ-transplant">After Receiving an Organ Transplant: Usually Permanent Deferral</h2>

<p>While being on the organ donor registry is perfectly fine, having <em>received</em> an organ transplant is a completely different situation. Organ transplant recipients are almost always permanently deferred from donating plasma.</p>

<h3>Why Transplant Recipients Cannot Donate Plasma</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Immunosuppressant medications:</strong> The primary reason for permanent deferral is not the transplant itself -- it is the lifelong immunosuppressant drugs required to prevent organ rejection. These medications suppress your immune system, which means your plasma has an altered immunological profile that makes it unsuitable for medical products</li>
    <li><strong>Altered immune function:</strong> Plasma products (immunoglobulins, clotting factors, albumin) are manufactured from donated plasma. The plasma must come from donors with normal, functional immune systems. Immunosuppressed donors produce abnormal antibody profiles</li>
    <li><strong>Infection risk:</strong> Immunosuppressed individuals are at higher risk for infections that may not be detected by standard plasma screening tests. This creates a safety concern for the blood supply</li>
    <li><strong>Medication contamination:</strong> Immunosuppressant drugs circulate in your blood and plasma. These medications in the donated plasma could theoretically affect the recipients of plasma-derived products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Which Transplants Cause Permanent Deferral?</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Transplant Type</th><th>Plasma Donation Eligible?</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Kidney transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Liver transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Heart transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Lung transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Pancreas transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Small bowel transplant</strong></td><td>No (permanent deferral)</td><td>Lifelong immunosuppressants required</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Corneal transplant</strong></td><td>Usually yes (after healing)</td><td>Corneal transplants typically do not require systemic immunosuppressants</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Skin graft (autologous)</strong></td><td>Usually yes (after healing)</td><td>Using your own skin does not require immunosuppression</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>The Exception: Corneal Transplants</h3>
<p>Corneal transplants are a notable exception. Because the cornea is an immune-privileged site (it has limited blood supply), most corneal transplant recipients do not require lifelong systemic immunosuppressants. They may use topical immunosuppressive eye drops, but these do not systemically affect your plasma. Most plasma centers will accept corneal transplant recipients after the surgical recovery period, provided they are not on systemic immunosuppressant medications.</p>

<h2 id="immunosuppressants">Immunosuppressant Medications and Deferral</h2>

<p>The key disqualifier for organ transplant recipients is not the transplant surgery itself -- it is the immunosuppressant medications. Understanding these medications helps explain why deferral is permanent:</p>

<h3>Common Immunosuppressants That Defer Plasma Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tacrolimus (Prograf):</strong> The most commonly used anti-rejection drug. Suppresses T-cell activation. Taken indefinitely after transplant</li>
    <li><strong>Mycophenolate (CellCept, Myfortic):</strong> Inhibits B and T cell proliferation. Taken in combination with other immunosuppressants</li>
    <li><strong>Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune):</strong> Calcineurin inhibitor similar to tacrolimus. Used in some transplant protocols</li>
    <li><strong>Sirolimus (Rapamune) / Everolimus (Zortress):</strong> mTOR inhibitors used as alternatives or additions to calcineurin inhibitors</li>
    <li><strong>Prednisone:</strong> Corticosteroid used at low doses long-term in many transplant protocols. Suppresses immune response broadly</li>
    <li><strong>Azathioprine (Imuran):</strong> Older immunosuppressant still used in some protocols. Suppresses bone marrow production of immune cells</li>
    <li><strong>Belatacept (Nulojix):</strong> Newer biologic immunosuppressant given as monthly IV infusion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why You Cannot Just Stop Taking Them</h3>
<p>Some people ask whether they can stop their immunosuppressants temporarily to donate plasma. <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Stopping immunosuppressant medications -- even briefly -- can trigger acute organ rejection, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. Your transplanted organ requires continuous immune suppression to prevent your body from attacking it as foreign tissue. Never alter your immunosuppressant regimen for any reason without your transplant team's explicit direction.</p>

<h3>Immunosuppressants for Non-Transplant Conditions</h3>
<p>Some people take immunosuppressant medications for autoimmune conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease, psoriasis) rather than for organ transplants. The deferral rules for these medications vary:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low-dose methotrexate:</strong> May or may not defer you depending on the center and the dose. Disclose during screening</li>
    <li><strong>Biologics (Humira, Enbrel, Remicade):</strong> Generally defer from plasma donation due to their immunosuppressive effects</li>
    <li><strong>Low-dose prednisone (for non-transplant use):</strong> Short courses may not defer you. Chronic use typically does. Center policies vary</li>
    <li><strong>Always disclose:</strong> List every medication on your health screening questionnaire. The medical staff will determine whether your specific medication and dose defer you</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="living-organ-donors">Living Organ Donors: Can You Donate Plasma?</h2>

<p>If you have donated a kidney or part of your liver to someone else (living donor organ transplant), your eligibility for plasma donation is different from transplant recipients:</p>

<h3>Living Kidney Donors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Generally eligible after recovery:</strong> Living kidney donors do not take immunosuppressant medications (the recipient does). Once you have fully recovered from the surgical procedure (typically 6-12 months), you may be eligible to donate plasma</li>
    <li><strong>One kidney considerations:</strong> With one kidney, your body still functions normally for plasma donation purposes. Your remaining kidney compensates fully, and plasma donation does not place additional strain on kidney function</li>
    <li><strong>Surgical recovery period:</strong> Most centers require 6-12 months after any major surgery involving general anesthesia. The kidney donation recovery period typically satisfies this requirement</li>
    <li><strong>Medical clearance:</strong> Some plasma centers may request clearance from your nephrologist (kidney doctor) confirming that your remaining kidney function is normal and that plasma donation is safe for you</li>
</ul>

<h3>Living Liver Donors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Potentially eligible after full regeneration:</strong> The liver regenerates to near-original size within 6-8 weeks of partial donation. After full recovery (typically 6-12 months), you may be eligible for plasma donation</li>
    <li><strong>Liver function must be normal:</strong> Your liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin, albumin) must be within normal ranges. Since plasma contains proteins produced by the liver (especially albumin), adequate liver function is essential</li>
    <li><strong>Less common:</strong> Living liver donation is rarer than kidney donation, and fewer plasma centers have established protocols for evaluating these donors. Be prepared for additional medical review</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Difference from Recipients</h3>
<p>The critical distinction is that living organ <em>donors</em> do not take immunosuppressant medications. The medications are taken by the <em>recipient</em> of the organ, not the person who donated it. Since it is the immunosuppressants that cause permanent deferral (not the surgery itself), living donors have a path back to plasma donation eligibility once they have fully recovered.</p>

<h2 id="bone-marrow-tissue">Bone Marrow and Tissue Donation Compatibility</h2>

<p>Beyond solid organ donation, people often wonder about compatibility between plasma donation and other types of donation:</p>

<h3>Bone Marrow / Stem Cell Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Being on the bone marrow registry:</strong> Registering with Be The Match or other bone marrow registries does not affect plasma donation eligibility. You can be registered on the marrow registry and donate plasma simultaneously</li>
    <li><strong>After donating bone marrow:</strong> If you have actually donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, most plasma centers require a waiting period (typically 6-12 months) for your body to fully recover before resuming plasma donation</li>
    <li><strong>No permanent deferral:</strong> Unlike organ transplant recipients, bone marrow donors do not take lifelong immunosuppressants. After the recovery period, you can return to regular plasma donation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tissue Donation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blood transfusion:</strong> If you received a blood or plasma transfusion, most centers require a 12-month waiting period before you can donate plasma</li>
    <li><strong>Skin grafts:</strong> Autologous skin grafts (using your own skin) require only surgical recovery time. Allograft skin (from a cadaver donor) may require additional evaluation</li>
    <li><strong>Bone or tendon grafts:</strong> Surgical recovery period applies. If no immunosuppressants are required, you can return to plasma donation after healing</li>
    <li><strong>Heart valve replacement:</strong> Mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valves do not necessarily defer you, but the medications associated with them (anticoagulants like warfarin) typically do</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blood-vs-plasma-vs-organ">Blood vs Plasma vs Organ Donation: Key Differences</h2>

<p>Understanding the differences between these three types of donation helps clarify why the eligibility rules differ:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Whole Blood Donation</th><th>Plasma Donation</th><th>Organ Donation</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>When it happens</strong></td><td>While alive</td><td>While alive</td><td>After death (or living donation)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>Every 56 days</td><td>Up to twice per week</td><td>Once (posthumous) or once (living)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>What is removed</strong></td><td>Whole blood (all components)</td><td>Plasma only (red cells returned)</td><td>Entire organ(s)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Recovery time</strong></td><td>24-48 hours full recovery</td><td>24-48 hours full recovery</td><td>N/A (posthumous) or months (living)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Compensation</strong></td><td>Not paid (volunteer only)</td><td>Paid ($50-$100+ per visit)</td><td>Not paid (illegal to sell organs)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Regulated by</strong></td><td>FDA / AABB</td><td>FDA</td><td>UNOS / OPTN</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Used for</strong></td><td>Transfusions</td><td>Plasma-derived medicines</td><td>Transplant surgery</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can participate in all three programs simultaneously -- be on the organ donor registry, donate plasma twice a week, and donate whole blood every 56 days -- as long as you meet the eligibility requirements for each. The only scheduling consideration is that whole blood donation temporarily defers you from plasma donation (typically 56 days) and vice versa (plasma centers may require you to wait after a recent whole blood donation).</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I am on the organ donor registry?</h3>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Being on the organ donor registry has no effect whatsoever on your plasma donation eligibility. The organ donor registry records your wishes for posthumous organ donation, while plasma donation is an activity you do while alive. Plasma centers do not check or access the organ donor registry, and your registration status will never come up during screening.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma after receiving a kidney transplant?</h3>
<p>No. Kidney transplant recipients are permanently deferred from plasma donation because of the lifelong immunosuppressant medications required to prevent organ rejection. These medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone, etc.) alter your immune system and disqualify your plasma from use in medical products. This applies to all solid organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas).</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I donated a kidney to someone?</h3>
<p>Potentially yes, after a recovery period. Living kidney donors do not take immunosuppressant medications (the recipient does). After full surgical recovery (typically 6-12 months), you may be eligible for plasma donation. Your remaining kidney compensates fully, and plasma donation does not strain kidney function. Some centers may request clearance from your nephrologist.</p>

<h3>Does plasma donation affect my organs?</h3>
<p>No. Plasma donation removes fluid and proteins that your body naturally replenishes within 24-48 hours. It does not damage or weaken any organs. Regular plasma donation has been studied extensively and does not affect organ function or organ viability for future transplant purposes. Your liver produces replacement plasma proteins, and your bone marrow produces replacement blood cells.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma after a corneal transplant?</h3>
<p>Usually yes, after the surgical recovery period. Corneal transplants are a notable exception among organ transplants because the cornea is an immune-privileged site that typically does not require lifelong systemic immunosuppressant medications. Most corneal transplant recipients use only topical immunosuppressive eye drops, which do not affect plasma eligibility. Confirm with your specific plasma center.</p>
