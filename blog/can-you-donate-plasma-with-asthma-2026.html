<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p><strong>Yes</strong> &mdash; most people with mild to moderate asthma <strong>can</strong> donate plasma. Rescue inhalers (albuterol) and maintenance inhalers (fluticasone, Advair, Symbicort) are accepted at all major plasma centers. Your asthma needs to be <strong>well-controlled</strong> on the day of donation &mdash; no active wheezing, no recent ER visits, and stable breathing. Severe or uncontrolled asthma may result in a temporary or permanent deferral depending on the center and your specific situation.</p></div>

<p>Asthma affects roughly 27 million Americans, so it is no surprise that "can you donate plasma with asthma" is one of the most frequently searched eligibility questions. The good news is that the vast majority of asthmatic donors qualify without any issues. Plasma centers evaluate your individual case during the health screening, and if your condition is managed, you will likely be cleared to donate.</p>

<p>This guide covers everything you need to know: which severity levels are accepted, which medications are fine (and which might cause problems), how the screening process works, when you should reschedule, and specific tips to make your donation experience smooth and safe.</p>

<h2 id="severity">Asthma Severity and Eligibility</h2>

<p>Not all asthma is the same. The severity of your condition plays the largest role in whether a plasma center will accept you as a donor. Asthma is classified into four categories by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and each carries different implications for plasma donation eligibility.</p>

<h3>Mild Intermittent Asthma</h3>
<p><strong>Eligibility: Accepted at all centers.</strong></p>
<p>If you experience asthma symptoms two days or fewer per week, use your rescue inhaler no more than twice a week, and have no interference with normal activities, you have mild intermittent asthma. This is the most common form, and plasma centers have no concerns about donors in this category. You may only need your rescue inhaler during exercise, seasonal changes, or occasional exposure to triggers. Your lung function between episodes is normal, and the donation process poses no meaningful risk.</p>

<h3>Mild Persistent Asthma</h3>
<p><strong>Eligibility: Accepted at all centers.</strong></p>
<p>With mild persistent asthma, symptoms occur more than twice a week but not daily. You may use a low-dose maintenance inhaler such as fluticasone (Flovent) alongside your rescue inhaler. As long as your symptoms are controlled on the day of donation and you are not experiencing a flare-up, you will be cleared. Many regular plasma donors fall into this category and donate twice per week without any complications.</p>

<h3>Moderate Persistent Asthma</h3>
<p><strong>Eligibility: Usually accepted, case by case.</strong></p>
<p>Daily symptoms, nighttime symptoms more than once per week, and the use of medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids or combination inhalers (like Advair or Symbicort) characterize moderate persistent asthma. Most plasma centers will still accept you, provided your symptoms are well-controlled at the time of your visit. The screening nurse or physician will likely ask more detailed questions about your management plan, recent exacerbations, and current symptom status. If your peak flow readings are in a good range and you are not wheezing, you should be approved.</p>

<h3>Severe Persistent Asthma</h3>
<p><strong>Eligibility: Case by case, possible deferral.</strong></p>
<p>Severe persistent asthma involves continuous symptoms throughout the day, frequent nighttime awakenings, limited physical activity, and often requires high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, or biologic medications. This is where plasma donation eligibility becomes uncertain. Some centers will defer you if you are on daily oral steroids or biologic injections. Others will evaluate your current stability and make a determination on-site. If you fall into this category, call your center in advance to discuss your specific medications and history before making the trip.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Asthma Severity</th><th>Donation Eligibility</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Mild Intermittent</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Rescue inhaler only, symptoms rare</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mild Persistent</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Low-dose maintenance inhaler OK</td></tr>
<tr><td>Moderate Persistent</td><td>Usually Accepted</td><td>Combination inhalers OK if controlled</td></tr>
<tr><td>Severe Persistent</td><td>Case by Case</td><td>Oral steroids or biologics may defer</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="medications">Accepted Asthma Medications</h2>

<p>One of the biggest concerns for asthmatic donors is whether their medications will disqualify them. For the vast majority of asthma drugs, the answer is no. Plasma centers are primarily concerned with medications that affect blood clotting, immune function, or that indicate a condition too severe for safe donation. Standard asthma medications do not fall into those categories.</p>

<h3>Rescue Inhalers (Short-Acting Bronchodilators)</h3>
<p>These are universally accepted at every plasma center:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Albuterol</strong> (ProAir, Ventolin, Proventil) &mdash; the most common rescue inhaler</li>
<li><strong>Levalbuterol</strong> (Xopenex) &mdash; a refined version of albuterol with fewer side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>These medications work locally in the lungs, have minimal systemic effects, and do not impact plasma quality in any way. You can use your rescue inhaler immediately before donation if needed.</p>

<h3>Inhaled Corticosteroids (Maintenance Inhalers)</h3>
<p>All inhaled corticosteroids are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluticasone</strong> (Flovent, ArmonAir)</li>
<li><strong>Budesonide</strong> (Pulmicort)</li>
<li><strong>Beclomethasone</strong> (QVAR)</li>
<li><strong>Mometasone</strong> (Asmanex)</li>
<li><strong>Ciclesonide</strong> (Alvesco)</li>
</ul>
<p>These deliver a tiny dose of corticosteroid directly to the airways. The amount that enters your bloodstream is negligible, which is why plasma centers do not consider them a disqualifying factor.</p>

<h3>Combination Inhalers</h3>
<p>Combination inhalers that pair a corticosteroid with a long-acting bronchodilator are also accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advair</strong> (fluticasone + salmeterol)</li>
<li><strong>Symbicort</strong> (budesonide + formoterol)</li>
<li><strong>Breo Ellipta</strong> (fluticasone + vilanterol)</li>
<li><strong>Dulera</strong> (mometasone + formoterol)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Acting Bronchodilators (LABAs)</h3>
<p>Standalone long-acting bronchodilators are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salmeterol</strong> (Serevent)</li>
<li><strong>Formoterol</strong> (Perforomist)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Leukotriene Modifiers</h3>
<p>Oral medications that block inflammatory pathways are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Montelukast</strong> (Singulair)</li>
<li><strong>Zafirlukast</strong> (Accolate)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Antihistamines</h3>
<p>If you take antihistamines for allergy-related asthma, these are also fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cetirizine</strong> (Zyrtec)</li>
<li><strong>Loratadine</strong> (Claritin)</li>
<li><strong>Fexofenadine</strong> (Allegra)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem-meds">Medications That May Cause Issues</h2>

<p>While most asthma medications are perfectly fine, a few categories can raise red flags during the screening process. These do not automatically disqualify you, but they may lead to additional questions, a temporary deferral, or in some cases, a permanent deferral at certain centers.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Oral Corticosteroids</h3>
<p>If you take <strong>prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone</strong> on a daily or near-daily basis for asthma management, most centers will defer you. Oral corticosteroids at systemic doses suppress the immune system and can affect the composition of your plasma. A short burst of oral steroids (such as a 5-day prednisone taper for a flare-up) will typically result in a temporary deferral &mdash; usually 7 to 30 days after completing the course, depending on the center.</p>

<h3>Biologic Medications</h3>
<p>Biologic drugs used for severe asthma are the most likely to cause a deferral:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Omalizumab</strong> (Xolair) &mdash; anti-IgE antibody</li>
<li><strong>Dupilumab</strong> (Dupixent) &mdash; anti-IL-4/IL-13 antibody</li>
<li><strong>Mepolizumab</strong> (Nucala) &mdash; anti-IL-5 antibody</li>
<li><strong>Benralizumab</strong> (Fasenra) &mdash; anti-IL-5 receptor antibody</li>
<li><strong>Tezepelumab</strong> (Tezspire) &mdash; anti-TSLP antibody</li>
</ul>
<p>These medications are monoclonal antibodies that significantly modify immune function. Many plasma centers will permanently defer donors on biologic therapies because these drugs are present in the plasma and could theoretically affect the manufactured products derived from donated plasma. If you are on any biologic medication, call your center before visiting &mdash; policies vary, and some centers may accept you while others will not.</p>

<h3>Theophylline</h3>
<p><strong>Theophylline</strong> (Theo-24, Elixophyllin) is an older bronchodilator that is rarely prescribed today but still used by some patients. It has a narrow therapeutic window and systemic effects. Some centers may ask additional questions about your dosage and stability, but theophylline alone is generally not a disqualifying medication.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Prednisone Bursts</h3>
<p>If your doctor prescribed a short course of oral steroids for a recent flare-up, you will likely face a temporary deferral. The typical waiting periods are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Typical Deferral Period</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>3-5 day prednisone taper</td><td>7-14 days after last dose</td></tr>
<tr><td>7-10 day steroid course</td><td>14-30 days after last dose</td></tr>
<tr><td>ER visit with IV steroids</td><td>30+ days, physician evaluation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ongoing daily oral steroids</td><td>Indefinite deferral at most centers</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="screening">What Happens During Screening If You Have Asthma</h2>

<p>Every plasma donation begins with a health screening, and knowing what to expect when you disclose your asthma will help you feel prepared and confident. The screening process at most centers follows a standard pattern.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Health History Questionnaire</h3>
<p>You will complete a written or digital questionnaire that asks about your medical conditions and current medications. When the form asks about respiratory conditions or chronic illnesses, you will check "yes" and list asthma. You will also list all medications, including inhalers. Be honest and thorough &mdash; withholding medical information can result in a permanent ban if discovered later.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Vital Signs Check</h3>
<p>A technician will measure your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and in some cases, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). For asthmatic donors, the SpO2 reading is particularly relevant. Most centers require an oxygen saturation of 95% or higher. If your asthma is well-controlled, your SpO2 will typically be 97-100%, well within the acceptable range. If you are wheezing or in mild distress, your SpO2 might dip below the threshold, which would result in a deferral for that day.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Physician or Nurse Review</h3>
<p>A staff physician or nurse will review your questionnaire and may ask follow-up questions about your asthma, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When were you diagnosed?</li>
<li>What medications do you currently use?</li>
<li>How often do you use your rescue inhaler?</li>
<li>When was your last asthma flare-up or ER visit?</li>
<li>Have you been hospitalized for asthma?</li>
<li>Is your asthma currently well-controlled?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer these questions straightforwardly. The goal is not to catch you in a disqualification &mdash; it is to confirm that donating plasma is safe for you and that your plasma is suitable for manufacturing.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Approval or Deferral</h3>
<p>Based on your answers and vital signs, you will either be approved to proceed or deferred. If deferred, the staff will explain why and tell you when you can try again. Most asthma-related deferrals are temporary &mdash; for example, "come back in two weeks after your steroid course is finished" rather than a permanent disqualification.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-reschedule">When to Reschedule Your Donation</h2>

<p>Even if you are generally eligible to donate plasma with asthma, there are specific situations where you should reschedule your appointment. Donating during these times could be unsafe for you or result in a deferral at the center.</p>

<h3>Reschedule If You Are Experiencing:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active wheezing or shortness of breath</strong> &mdash; This is the most obvious sign that today is not a good day to donate. Your SpO2 may be low, and the stress of donation could worsen symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>A current asthma flare-up</strong> &mdash; If you have been using your rescue inhaler more than usual over the past few days, your asthma is not well-controlled enough for donation.</li>
<li><strong>You are on a prednisone burst</strong> &mdash; Wait until you have completed the course and the required waiting period has passed.</li>
<li><strong>Recent ER or urgent care visit for asthma</strong> &mdash; Wait at least 30 days, or whatever your center requires. An ER visit signals a significant loss of control.</li>
<li><strong>Recent hospitalization for asthma</strong> &mdash; This typically requires a longer waiting period (60-90 days at some centers) and may require a physician's clearance letter.</li>
<li><strong>Upper respiratory infection</strong> &mdash; A cold, flu, or respiratory infection on top of asthma is a double reason to stay home. Wait until you are fully recovered.</li>
<li><strong>Recent change in asthma medication</strong> &mdash; If your doctor just changed your maintenance medication, give it 2-4 weeks to stabilize before donating.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p>If you would hesitate to do a 30-minute brisk walk today because of your breathing, you should reschedule your plasma donation. While donating plasma is not physically demanding, your body needs to be in a stable, healthy baseline state.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="tips">Tips for Asthmatic Donors</h2>

<p>Donating plasma with asthma is straightforward for most people, but a few extra precautions can make the experience smoother and help you avoid unexpected deferrals.</p>

<h3>Before Your Visit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bring your rescue inhaler</strong> &mdash; This is the single most important tip. Keep it in your pocket, not in your car. If you experience any tightness during the donation, you will have it immediately available.</li>
<li><strong>Take your maintenance medications as scheduled</strong> &mdash; Do not skip doses before donating. Controlled asthma is what gets you approved.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrate more than usual</strong> &mdash; Dehydration can make asthma symptoms worse and also makes the donation process slower (your veins are harder to access). Drink at least 64 ounces of water in the 24 hours before donating.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid known triggers</strong> &mdash; If pet dander, dust, perfume, or cold air triggers your asthma, take steps to minimize exposure in the hours before your appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Check the air quality</strong> &mdash; If you have air quality-sensitive asthma, check the AQI (Air Quality Index) before heading out. High pollution or wildfire smoke days are bad days to donate.</li>
<li><strong>Eat a protein-rich meal</strong> &mdash; This is good advice for all donors, but especially important for those with chronic conditions. A well-nourished body handles the donation process better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Your Visit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disclose your asthma honestly</strong> &mdash; Trying to hide it can backfire. If you have a reaction during donation and the staff does not know about your asthma, their response time may be slower.</li>
<li><strong>Mention specific triggers</strong> &mdash; If you know that cold air or strong scents trigger you, let the staff know. Some donation rooms are heavily air-conditioned, and staff can sometimes adjust.</li>
<li><strong>Stay calm and breathe normally</strong> &mdash; Anxiety can mimic or trigger mild asthma symptoms. Use relaxation techniques if you feel nervous. Listen to music, watch a show on your phone, or practice slow breathing.</li>
<li><strong>Speak up immediately</strong> &mdash; If you feel any chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath during the donation, alert staff right away. They can pause or stop the process safely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Your Visit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rest for 10-15 minutes before leaving</strong> &mdash; Do not rush out. Sit in the recovery area, drink fluids, and make sure your breathing is normal before driving home.</li>
<li><strong>Continue hydrating</strong> &mdash; Drink plenty of water for the rest of the day to help your body replenish the donated plasma.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor your breathing</strong> &mdash; Pay attention to how you feel for the next few hours. If you notice increased asthma symptoms after donating, discuss this with your doctor before your next donation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-Specific Policies</h2>

<p>While the general rule is that well-controlled asthma is accepted, each plasma company sets its own specific screening criteria. Here is what to expect at the major chains.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Policies can differ between individual locations within the same chain. A staff physician at one CSL Plasma location may make a different judgment call than a physician at another location. If you are deferred at one center, it does not necessarily mean you will be deferred everywhere. That said, some centers share deferral records within their network, so always be honest about your history.</p>

<p>Before your first visit, call the center and ask: "I have asthma and take [your specific medications]. Am I eligible to donate?" This 2-minute phone call can save you a wasted trip.</p>

<h2 id="allergy-asthma">Allergy-Triggered Asthma Considerations</h2>

<p>Many people with asthma have allergic asthma, meaning their symptoms are triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander, or cockroach droppings. If this describes you, here are specific considerations for plasma donation.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Allergies and Asthma</h3>
<p>If your asthma worsens during specific seasons (spring pollen, fall ragweed, etc.), you may find it easier to donate during your "good" seasons. During peak allergy season, you might experience more rescue inhaler use and borderline symptoms that could lead to a deferral. Consider these strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-treat with antihistamines</strong> &mdash; Taking your allergy medication (Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra) consistently during allergy season helps keep asthma under control. All antihistamines are accepted for plasma donation.</li>
<li><strong>Use nasal corticosteroid spray</strong> &mdash; Flonase, Nasacort, and similar sprays reduce nasal inflammation that can trigger asthma. These are accepted at all centers.</li>
<li><strong>Donate on low-pollen days</strong> &mdash; Check pollen counts and schedule your donation on lower-count days when possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Allergy Shots (Immunotherapy)</h3>
<p>If you receive allergy shots (subcutaneous immunotherapy), most plasma centers ask that you wait at least 24 hours after an injection before donating. Some centers require a 48-hour wait. This is because allergy shots can cause mild systemic reactions that could be confused with donation-related complications. If you are on allergy shots, schedule your plasma donation on a different day than your injection day.</p>

<h3>Allergy Testing</h3>
<p>If you recently had allergy skin prick testing or blood allergy testing, this generally does not affect your plasma donation eligibility. However, if the testing triggered an asthma flare-up, wait until your symptoms have fully resolved.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-induced">Exercise-Induced Asthma</h2>

<p>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), commonly called exercise-induced asthma, is one of the mildest forms of asthma &mdash; and the best news for people with this condition is that <strong>plasma donation does not involve physical exertion</strong>.</p>

<h3>Why EIB Donors Are Almost Always Approved</h3>
<p>People with exercise-induced asthma only experience symptoms during or after vigorous physical activity. Since donating plasma involves sitting or reclining in a chair for 45-90 minutes, the conditions that trigger EIB simply are not present during the donation process. You are at no greater risk than someone without asthma.</p>

<h3>Tips for EIB Donors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not exercise immediately before donating</strong> &mdash; If you plan to work out, do it after your donation, not before. Arriving at the center winded or wheezy from a workout could get you deferred.</li>
<li><strong>Mention EIB during screening</strong> &mdash; When asked about asthma, specify that yours is exercise-induced only. This context helps the screening staff understand that your condition is mild and well-managed.</li>
<li><strong>Bring your rescue inhaler anyway</strong> &mdash; Even though EIB is unlikely to be triggered during donation, it is always good practice to have your medication available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can You Exercise After Donating Plasma?</h3>
<p>Whether or not you have EIB, strenuous exercise is not recommended for at least 4-6 hours after donating plasma. Your body has lost fluid and protein, and your blood volume is temporarily reduced. For people with exercise-induced asthma, this is doubly important &mdash; exercising in a dehydrated, depleted state could trigger more severe symptoms than usual. Wait until the next day for intense workouts.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have asthma?</h3>
<p>Yes, most people with mild to moderate asthma can donate plasma. You need to have your asthma well-controlled, pass the vital signs screening, and not be experiencing active symptoms like wheezing or shortness of breath on the day of donation.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I use an inhaler?</h3>
<p>Yes. Rescue inhalers like albuterol (ProAir, Ventolin) and maintenance inhalers like fluticasone (Flovent), Advair, and Symbicort are all accepted at plasma centers. Bring your inhaler with you in case you need it during the visit.</p>

<h3>Will asthma medication disqualify me from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Standard asthma medications like inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and combination inhalers will not disqualify you. However, long-term oral corticosteroids (like daily prednisone) or biologic injections (like Xolair or Dupixent) may cause a temporary or permanent deferral depending on the center.</p>

<h3>What if I have an asthma attack at the plasma center?</h3>
<p>Staff will stop the donation immediately and provide assistance. This is why you should always bring your rescue inhaler. If you experience an asthma attack during donation, most centers will ask you to wait a period (often 24-48 hours or longer) before attempting to donate again.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma with exercise-induced asthma?</h3>
<p>Yes. Exercise-induced asthma (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) is one of the mildest forms and rarely affects plasma donation eligibility. Since donating plasma does not involve physical exertion, symptoms are unlikely to be triggered during the process.</p>

<h3>Should I use my inhaler before donating plasma?</h3>
<p>You should follow your normal medication schedule. Do not skip maintenance inhalers before donating. If you typically use a rescue inhaler before activities, you do not need to pre-treat before plasma donation since it is not physically strenuous. However, bring your inhaler just in case.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I recently had an asthma flare-up?</h3>
<p>You should wait until your asthma is back under control. Most centers recommend waiting at least 7 days after an asthma flare-up, and longer if you needed oral steroids, a nebulizer treatment, or an ER visit. Wait until you are breathing comfortably without extra medication.</p>

<h3>Do different plasma centers have different asthma policies?</h3>
<p>Yes. CSL Plasma, BioLife, Grifols, and other chains each set their own medical screening criteria. While most accept well-controlled asthma, the specific questions asked and acceptable medication lists can vary. Call your local center before your first visit to confirm their policy.</p>
