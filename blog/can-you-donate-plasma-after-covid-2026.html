<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p><strong>Yes, you can donate plasma after having COVID.</strong> Wait 14 days after your symptoms fully resolve (no fever for at least 48 hours without medication). There is no waiting period after COVID vaccination at most centers. Convalescent plasma programs ended in 2023 &mdash; all donations now go through standard source plasma collection.</p></div>

<p>If you recently had COVID and want to get back to donating plasma, you are far from alone. Since 2020, this has been one of the most common eligibility questions at every major plasma center in the United States. The good news is that the rules have become simpler and more standardized as the pandemic has evolved into an endemic phase. The short version: a 14-day symptom-free waiting period after infection, no wait after vaccination, and no permanent disqualification from having had COVID.</p>

<p>This guide covers everything you need to know about COVID-related plasma donation rules in 2026, including wait times after infection, vaccines, antivirals, long COVID considerations, and how the pandemic permanently changed the plasma industry.</p>

<h2 id="current-policies">Current 2026 COVID Donation Policies</h2>

<p>COVID policies at plasma centers have changed dramatically since the early days of the pandemic. In 2020 and 2021, rules shifted almost weekly as the FDA, CDC, and individual companies scrambled to respond to new variants and emerging data. By late 2022, policies began to stabilize. In 2026, most centers follow a consistent set of guidelines that treat COVID similarly to other respiratory illnesses.</p>

<h3>What Has Changed Since the Pandemic</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No more emergency COVID screening:</strong> The extensive COVID-specific questionnaires from 2020-2022 have been replaced with general illness screening questions</li>
<li><strong>Standard respiratory illness protocols:</strong> COVID is now treated similarly to the flu or other respiratory infections at most centers</li>
<li><strong>Convalescent plasma collection ended:</strong> The FDA revoked its emergency use authorization in January 2023</li>
<li><strong>Mask requirements dropped:</strong> Most centers removed mandatory masking policies in 2023-2024, though some may still recommend them during local surges</li>
<li><strong>Temperature checks remain:</strong> The one screening step that stuck around from the pandemic era</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Core Rule in 2026</h3>
<p>Across nearly all major plasma collection companies, the baseline rule is the same: <strong>wait 14 days after your symptoms fully resolve before donating plasma</strong>. This applies whether you tested positive with symptoms, tested positive without symptoms (counting from the test date), or had symptoms but never tested. The 14-day window gives your body time to recover and ensures your plasma meets quality standards for the pharmaceutical products it will be used to manufacture.</p>

<p>Some centers may use a slightly shorter or longer window (anywhere from 10 to 21 days), but 14 days is the most common standard. Always call your specific center to confirm their current policy before showing up after a recent infection.</p>

<h2 id="wait-times">Wait Times Breakdown: Every COVID Scenario</h2>

<table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Wait Time</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>COVID with symptoms (recovered)</td><td>14 days after symptoms resolve</td><td>Must be fever-free 48+ hours without medication</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID positive, no symptoms</td><td>14 days after positive test date</td><td>Some centers allow 10 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID vaccine (mRNA: Pfizer/Moderna)</td><td>No wait</td><td>Wait only if you have side effects (fever, fatigue)</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID vaccine (Novavax protein-based)</td><td>No wait</td><td>Same as mRNA vaccines</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID vaccine with side effects</td><td>24-48 hours after side effects resolve</td><td>Must be symptom-free at donation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paxlovid treatment</td><td>14 days after completing treatment + symptom-free</td><td>Standard post-illness waiting period</td></tr>
<tr><td>Molnupiravir treatment</td><td>14 days after completing treatment + symptom-free</td><td>Same as Paxlovid</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monoclonal antibody treatment</td><td>May require longer deferral</td><td>Check with your center; some require 60-90 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long COVID (mild, stable symptoms)</td><td>Case-by-case with medical clearance</td><td>Center physician evaluates individually</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long COVID (significant symptoms)</td><td>Deferred until improvement</td><td>Ongoing fatigue, breathing issues, or heart symptoms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Household exposure (no symptoms/negative)</td><td>No wait</td><td>Monitor for symptoms; do not donate if sick</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>What "Symptom-Free" Actually Means</h3>
<p>Centers are specific about what counts as recovered. You must meet all of these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No fever</strong> (below 99.5F / 37.5C) for at least 48 hours without using fever-reducing medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen</li>
<li><strong>No active respiratory symptoms:</strong> Cough, shortness of breath, and congestion should be resolved or nearly resolved</li>
<li><strong>No body aches or fatigue</strong> beyond your normal baseline</li>
<li><strong>Loss of taste/smell:</strong> This one is tricky. Most centers will allow donation even if taste and smell have not fully returned, as long as all other symptoms have resolved. This symptom can linger for weeks or months.</li>
<li><strong>Feeling well enough</strong> to go through the physical process of plasma donation, which takes 45-90 minutes and involves fluid removal from your body</li>
</ul>

<p>If you arrive at the center and your temperature reads above the cutoff, you will be turned away regardless of when your infection was. The temperature check happens every visit and is non-negotiable.</p>

<h2 id="vaccine">COVID Vaccine and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>One of the most common misconceptions is that you need to wait after getting a COVID vaccine before donating plasma. In 2026, this is straightforward: <strong>there is no mandatory waiting period after receiving any currently available COVID vaccine</strong>.</p>

<h3>Why No Wait Is Required</h3>
<p>The COVID vaccines approved and available in 2026 (updated mRNA formulations from Pfizer and Moderna, along with the Novavax protein-based vaccine) are not live-virus vaccines. The FDA's deferral guidelines for vaccines are based on whether the vaccine contains a live, attenuated virus. Since none of the COVID vaccines do, they fall into the "no deferral" category, the same as flu shots, tetanus boosters, and hepatitis B vaccines.</p>

<p>Live-virus vaccines (such as the MMR vaccine, chickenpox vaccine, or yellow fever vaccine) do require a waiting period, typically 14 to 28 days. But this does not apply to any COVID vaccine on the market.</p>

<h3>The Practical Exception</h3>
<p>While there is no formal deferral period, most centers will not let you donate if you are experiencing vaccine side effects. If you got your shot yesterday and woke up today with a 100.5F fever and body aches, you will fail the temperature check and symptom screening. The practical advice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule your donation before your vaccine</strong> or wait 2-3 days after</li>
<li>If you typically get noticeable side effects from COVID shots, plan your donation for 48 hours after vaccination</li>
<li>If you never get side effects, you can technically donate the same day (though most people would not want to)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="antivirals">After Paxlovid or Other Antiviral Treatment</h2>

<p>If you took Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), molnupiravir, or another antiviral medication to treat COVID, you are still eligible to donate plasma after recovery. The antiviral treatment itself does not create a separate deferral. However, the fact that you took antivirals means you had an active COVID infection, which triggers the standard 14-day post-recovery waiting period.</p>

<h3>Paxlovid Rebound and Donation Timing</h3>
<p>One important consideration is the well-documented "Paxlovid rebound" phenomenon, where symptoms return a few days after completing the five-day course. If this happens to you, your 14-day clock resets from when the rebound symptoms resolve, not from when you finished the medication. This means your total wait could be 3-4 weeks from your initial positive test.</p>

<p>Here is how to calculate your earliest donation date after Paxlovid:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete your 5-day Paxlovid course</li>
<li>Monitor for rebound symptoms for 5-7 days after finishing medication</li>
<li>If no rebound: count 14 days from when all symptoms resolved</li>
<li>If rebound occurs: count 14 days from when rebound symptoms resolved</li>
<li>Confirm you are fever-free for 48+ hours without medication</li>
</ol>

<h3>Monoclonal Antibody Treatments</h3>
<p>While monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID are rarely used in 2026, if you received one, be aware that these carry a longer deferral period at some centers. Because monoclonal antibodies are themselves derived from plasma and can affect the protein composition of your own plasma, some centers require a 60 to 90 day waiting period. This is similar to the deferral for receiving blood products. Always disclose any monoclonal antibody treatment to your center.</p>

<h2 id="long-covid">Long COVID and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Long COVID (also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, or PASC) remains a real concern for millions of Americans in 2026. If you have been experiencing ongoing symptoms weeks or months after your initial infection, your eligibility to donate plasma depends on the nature and severity of those symptoms.</p>

<h3>When You May Be Cleared to Donate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mild, stable symptoms:</strong> If your long COVID symptoms are limited to things like slightly reduced sense of smell, mild intermittent brain fog, or occasional fatigue that does not significantly impair daily function, many centers will allow you to donate. A center physician will likely evaluate you on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li><strong>Symptoms that are improving:</strong> If you are on a clear recovery trajectory and your symptoms are manageable, you may be eligible.</li>
<li><strong>Symptoms that only affect you occasionally:</strong> Intermittent symptoms that are not present at the time of donation may not trigger a deferral.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When You Will Likely Be Deferred</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing fatigue:</strong> Significant fatigue that limits daily activities is a concern because plasma donation temporarily removes fluids and proteins from your body, which can worsen fatigue</li>
<li><strong>Cardiovascular symptoms:</strong> Chest pain, heart palpitations, or shortness of breath at rest or with minimal exertion will result in deferral. These symptoms pose a safety risk during the donation process.</li>
<li><strong>Neurological symptoms:</strong> Severe brain fog, dizziness, or fainting episodes make the donation process potentially unsafe</li>
<li><strong>Autoimmune-like symptoms:</strong> Some long COVID patients develop autoimmune responses that could affect plasma quality</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Medical Clearance</h3>
<p>If you have long COVID and want to donate, your best path is to get a note from your primary care physician stating that you are medically stable enough for plasma donation. Bring this to your center along with any relevant medical records. The center's medical staff will make the final determination, but having documentation from your own doctor significantly helps your case.</p>

<h2 id="convalescent">The History of Convalescent Plasma Programs</h2>

<p>If you are searching for information about donating plasma after COVID, you may have come across references to "convalescent plasma" or "COVID plasma." Here is the full story of what happened and why these programs no longer exist.</p>

<h3>2020: The Emergency Response</h3>
<p>In the early months of the pandemic, before vaccines or antiviral treatments existed, convalescent plasma was one of the few therapeutic options available. The idea was simple: people who had recovered from COVID had antibodies in their plasma that could potentially help hospitalized patients fight the virus. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma in August 2020, and plasma centers across the country began specifically recruiting recovered COVID patients.</p>

<p>During this period, donors who had recovered from COVID were especially sought after. Some centers offered premium compensation for convalescent plasma donations, and the demand was enormous. Hospitals were ordering convalescent plasma as a treatment for severely ill COVID patients.</p>

<h3>2021: Growing Doubts</h3>
<p>As large-scale clinical trials produced results, the evidence for convalescent plasma became increasingly mixed. Studies showed that it was most effective when given very early in the illness and when the plasma had high antibody titers. But for most hospitalized patients, the benefit was modest at best. Meanwhile, vaccines became widely available, and monoclonal antibody treatments proved more effective and more consistent than convalescent plasma.</p>

<p>The FDA narrowed the EUA in February 2021, limiting convalescent plasma to patients early in their illness or those with weakened immune systems. Many hospitals began using it less frequently.</p>

<h3>2022-2023: The End of Convalescent Plasma</h3>
<p>By 2022, with high vaccination rates, effective antivirals like Paxlovid, and updated monoclonal antibodies, the clinical need for convalescent plasma had largely disappeared. The FDA officially revoked the emergency use authorization for COVID-19 convalescent plasma in January 2023. Plasma centers stopped collecting convalescent plasma entirely, and all COVID-recovered donors were folded back into the standard source plasma donor pool.</p>

<h3>What This Means in 2026</h3>
<p>In 2026, there is no such thing as a "COVID plasma donation." When you donate plasma after having had COVID, your plasma goes through the same manufacturing pipeline as everyone else's. It is used to produce immunoglobulin therapies, albumin, clotting factors, and other life-saving medications. The antibodies in your plasma from COVID recovery do not give it any special designation or value in the current plasma fractionation process.</p>

<h2 id="permanent-changes">How COVID Changed Plasma Donation Permanently</h2>

<p>Even though the acute phase of the pandemic is long over, COVID left a lasting mark on the plasma donation industry. Here are the changes that stuck around:</p>

<h3>Screening and Safety</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature checks at every visit:</strong> Before COVID, temperature screening was less universal. Now every major center checks your temperature at check-in, every single visit. This has actually helped catch other illnesses and fevers that would have previously gone unnoticed.</li>
<li><strong>Health questionnaires updated:</strong> The screening questions now include general respiratory illness queries that were added during COVID and never removed. "Have you had a fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the past 14 days?" is now standard.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced cleaning protocols:</strong> Centers significantly increased cleaning frequency during COVID, and most have maintained elevated sanitation standards. Donor beds, armrests, and touchpoints are cleaned between every donor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology and Convenience</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile app adoption:</strong> The pandemic accelerated the rollout of mobile apps at every major chain. Pre-screening questionnaires, appointment scheduling, and digital check-in were all fast-tracked during COVID to reduce lobby crowding. These tools are now standard and have meaningfully improved the donor experience.</li>
<li><strong>Appointment systems:</strong> Walk-in-only centers became rare after COVID. The appointment systems introduced to manage capacity during the pandemic are now permanent, giving donors better time management and reducing wait times.</li>
<li><strong>Contactless payment:</strong> Many centers moved to fully digital payment (prepaid debit cards loaded remotely) during COVID, reducing the need for physical card handling at the center.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Industry and Supply Chain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donor compensation increased:</strong> The pandemic caused a severe plasma supply shortage that took years to fully resolve. Centers raised pay rates to attract donors, and while there have been some adjustments, compensation remains meaningfully higher than pre-2020 levels.</li>
<li><strong>New centers opened:</strong> Every major plasma company expanded aggressively during and after the pandemic to address supply concerns. There are significantly more plasma centers operating in 2026 than there were in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>International supply diversification:</strong> The U.S. had already been the world's largest source plasma collector, but the pandemic reinforced this role and prompted some European and Asian markets to develop their own collection capacity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-by-Center 2026 COVID Policies</h2>

<p>While the 14-day post-recovery rule is nearly universal, there are minor differences between major plasma center chains. Here is what each company requires as of early 2026:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>Post-COVID Wait</th><th>Post-Vaccine Wait</th><th>Additional Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CSL Plasma</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>Standard respiratory illness protocol; temperature check required</td></tr>
<tr><td>BioLife Plasma (Takeda)</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>Health screening questions cover recent illness; app pre-screening available</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grifols / BPL Plasma</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>May ask about hospitalization; longer deferral if hospitalized for COVID</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octapharma Plasma</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>Standard screening; reports generally consistent enforcement</td></tr>
<tr><td>KEDPLASMA</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>Follows PPTA guidelines closely</td></tr>
<tr><td>ImmunoTek Bio Centers</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td><td>No deferral</td><td>Growing chain with standardized COVID protocol</td></tr>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Individual center locations may have slightly different interpretations of company-wide policy. If you are unsure, call your specific center location before visiting. The medical staff on duty makes the final eligibility determination.</p>

<h3>If You Were Hospitalized for COVID</h3>
<p>If your COVID infection was severe enough to require hospitalization, expect a longer deferral period. Most centers require at least 28 days (and sometimes longer) after discharge from the hospital before you can donate. If you received blood products, plasma, or monoclonal antibodies during your hospital stay, the deferral may extend to 90 days or more. Full disclosure of your hospitalization history is required and will be reviewed by the center's medical team.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-infections">Multiple COVID Infections and Cumulative Impact</h2>

<p>By 2026, many people have had COVID two, three, or even more times. A common concern is whether repeated infections create a cumulative problem for plasma donation eligibility.</p>

<h3>The Good News</h3>
<p>Having had COVID multiple times does <strong>not</strong> permanently disqualify you from donating plasma. There is no "three strikes" rule or cumulative infection limit. Each infection is treated independently: recover, wait 14 days symptom-free, and you are eligible again.</p>

<h3>Potential Concerns with Repeat Infections</h3>
<p>While there is no formal policy against repeat-infection donors, there are some practical considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immune system impact:</strong> Repeated infections can take a toll on your overall health. If your general health metrics (protein levels, hematocrit, blood pressure, pulse) are consistently borderline after multiple infections, you may see more frequent deferrals for failing standard screening criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery time may increase:</strong> Some people find that each subsequent COVID infection takes longer to recover from. If it takes you three weeks instead of one week to feel better, your time away from donating is longer.</li>
<li><strong>Long COVID risk increases:</strong> Research suggests that each reinfection carries some additional risk of developing long COVID symptoms, which could affect your donation eligibility as discussed above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking Your Infections</h3>
<p>Keep a record of your COVID infection dates and recovery timelines. This helps you accurately answer screening questions and calculate your eligible return date. Some centers may ask how many times you have had COVID, particularly if you are returning after a recent infection.</p>

<h2 id="testing">COVID Testing at Plasma Centers in 2026</h2>

<p>A question that comes up frequently: do plasma centers still test donors for COVID?</p>

<h3>Routine Testing: No</h3>
<p>The vast majority of plasma centers <strong>do not</strong> perform routine COVID testing on donors in 2026. The rapid-test screening that some centers implemented in 2020-2021 was discontinued as vaccines became widespread and the acute pandemic phase ended. Testing every donor for COVID is not cost-effective and is not required by the FDA for source plasma collection.</p>

<h3>What They Do Instead</h3>
<p>Centers rely on a combination of measures to screen for active illness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature check:</strong> A non-contact thermometer reading at check-in catches fevers from COVID and any other illness</li>
<li><strong>Health questionnaire:</strong> Questions about recent symptoms, illness, and exposures</li>
<li><strong>Visual assessment:</strong> Staff are trained to observe donors for visible signs of illness (coughing, congestion, pallor)</li>
<li><strong>Self-reporting:</strong> Donors are expected to be honest about their health status. Donating while actively sick is not only against the rules but also poses a safety risk to you and potentially to the products made from your plasma</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viral Testing of Plasma Products</h3>
<p>While individual donors are not tested for COVID, the plasma products themselves undergo extensive viral inactivation and testing during manufacturing. Plasma fractionation includes multiple virus-elimination steps (solvent/detergent treatment, pasteurization, nanofiltration) that are effective against coronaviruses and many other pathogens. This is a safety net built into the manufacturing process, not a replacement for donor screening.</p>

<h2 id="supply-pricing">How the Pandemic Affected Plasma Supply and Pricing</h2>

<p>COVID had a profound and lasting impact on the plasma industry's economics, and understanding this context helps explain why compensation remains relatively high in 2026.</p>

<h3>The Supply Crisis (2020-2022)</h3>
<p>When the pandemic hit in March 2020, plasma donations fell off a cliff. Lockdowns, fear of visiting medical facilities, and the economic stimulus payments that reduced financial pressure on potential donors all contributed to a dramatic decline. Collections dropped by an estimated 15-20% in 2020, creating a supply shortage that took years to resolve.</p>

<p>This mattered enormously because plasma-derived therapies are used by patients with immune deficiencies, hemophilia, and other serious conditions. These patients depend on a steady supply, and the manufacturing process takes 7-12 months from donation to finished product. The 2020 collection decline meant supply shortages in 2021 and 2022.</p>

<h3>The Compensation Response</h3>
<p>To attract donors back, every major center raised compensation. New donor bonuses of $800-$1,000 for the first month became common. Regular donor pay increased by 20-40% at many locations. Centers also invested heavily in new locations, technology, and marketing to grow their donor base.</p>

<h3>Where We Are in 2026</h3>
<p>Plasma collection volumes have fully recovered and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. However, the industry has not fully rolled back the compensation increases. Several factors keep pay relatively high:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> General cost-of-living increases mean the 2020 pay rates would be inadequate in 2026 dollars</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> More centers means more competition for donors, keeping compensation competitive</li>
<li><strong>Growing demand:</strong> The patient population requiring plasma-derived therapies continues to grow globally</li>
<li><strong>Donor retention:</strong> Centers learned during the pandemic that losing donors is expensive; retaining them with competitive pay is more cost-effective than constantly recruiting new ones</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps After COVID Recovery</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mark your calendar:</strong> Count 14 days from when your last COVID symptom resolved and schedule your return visit.</li>
<li><strong>Call your center:</strong> Confirm their specific post-COVID policy before you visit to avoid a wasted trip.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrate and eat well:</strong> Your body has been fighting an infection. Drink extra water and eat protein-rich meals in the days before your first post-COVID donation.</li>
<li><strong>Expect the standard screening:</strong> You will go through the normal health screening, not a special COVID protocol. Answer all questions honestly.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor how you feel:</strong> Your first donation back after illness may feel slightly more tiring than usual. Make sure you feel 100% before going, and plan a lighter day afterward.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma after having COVID?</h3>
<p>Yes. Most plasma centers require you to wait 14 days after your symptoms fully resolve or 14 days after a positive test if asymptomatic. You must be symptom-free with no fever for at least 48 hours before donating. There is no permanent disqualification from having had COVID.</p>

<h3>Do you have to wait after a COVID vaccine to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>At most major centers in 2026, there is no waiting period after receiving a COVID vaccine (mRNA or protein-based). Some centers may ask you to wait 24-48 hours if you have side effects like fever or fatigue. Live-virus vaccines (not applicable to current COVID shots) require a longer wait.</p>

<h3>Is convalescent plasma still being collected in 2026?</h3>
<p>No. The FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma in 2023. Plasma centers no longer collect COVID convalescent plasma. Standard source plasma collection has fully resumed with updated screening protocols. Your donation goes through the same process as every other donor's.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have long COVID?</h3>
<p>It depends on your symptoms. If long COVID symptoms are mild and stable, many centers will allow donation with medical clearance. If you have ongoing fatigue, shortness of breath, or cardiovascular symptoms, you may be temporarily deferred until symptoms improve. A note from your doctor can help your case.</p>

<h3>Do plasma centers still test for COVID in 2026?</h3>
<p>Most centers no longer perform routine COVID testing on donors in 2026. However, they still screen for symptoms through health questionnaires and temperature checks. If you report recent illness, you may be asked additional questions. The plasma manufacturing process includes viral inactivation steps.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma after taking Paxlovid?</h3>
<p>You must wait until you have completed the full course of Paxlovid and are symptom-free for at least 14 days. The antiviral itself does not permanently disqualify you, but the underlying infection triggers the standard 14-day post-recovery waiting period. Watch for Paxlovid rebound, which resets the clock.</p>

<h3>Did COVID change plasma donation pay rates?</h3>
<p>Yes. The pandemic caused a plasma supply shortage that drove compensation up significantly. While rates have stabilized since 2023, new donor bonuses and regular pay remain higher than pre-pandemic levels at most centers. Use our <a href="/">Plasma Pay Calculator</a> to check current rates.</p>

<h3>Can multiple COVID infections prevent you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Having had COVID multiple times does not permanently disqualify you from donating plasma. Each infection triggers its own 14-day recovery waiting period, but there is no cumulative limit. As long as you meet standard health requirements after recovery, you can donate.</p>
