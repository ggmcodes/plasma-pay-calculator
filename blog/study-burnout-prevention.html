            <p>Academic burnout isn't just feeling tired after a long study session‚Äîit's a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to academic stress. Unlike temporary fatigue, burnout fundamentally changes how you think, feel, and perform, creating a vicious cycle that can derail your entire academic journey.</p>

            <p>The stakes couldn't be higher. Research shows that burned-out students are <strong>3x more likely to drop out</strong>, experience <strong>50% lower academic performance</strong>, and develop long-term mental health issues that persist well beyond graduation. But here's the empowering truth: burnout is entirely preventable when you understand the warning signs and implement the right strategies.</p>

                <h4>üéØ Why This Guide Matters</h4>
                <p>This isn't about working less‚Äîit's about working sustainably. You'll learn to maintain peak performance while protecting your mental health, creating a foundation for lifelong success rather than short-term achievement at the expense of your well-being.</p>

                <p>Academic burnout manifests differently than regular stress or tiredness. It's characterized by three core dimensions that, when combined, create a perfect storm of academic dysfunction:</p>
