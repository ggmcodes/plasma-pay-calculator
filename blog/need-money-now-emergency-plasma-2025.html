        <div class="panic-relief">
            <h3>üõ°Ô∏è When You Need Money RIGHT NOW</h3>
            <p><strong>Emergencies don't wait for payday.</strong> They don't care about your credit score. They happen at the worst possible time when you have the least money available.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Plasma donation is emergency money because:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>Guaranteed payment</strong> - If you're healthy, you WILL get paid</li>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>Same-day money</strong> - Payment immediately after donation</li>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>No credit check</strong> - Your credit doesn't matter</li>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>No boss approval</strong> - You decide when to go</li>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>Available when banks are closed</strong> - Many centers open early/late</li>
                <li>‚úÖ <strong>Repeatable</strong> - Can donate again in 48+ hours</li>

            <h3>üéØ When $50 Is More Valuable Than $500</h3>
