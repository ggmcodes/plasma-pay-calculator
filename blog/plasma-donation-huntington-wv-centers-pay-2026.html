                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Tri-State Area Plasma Center Guide</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Huntington sits at the convergence of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio - the Tri-State area. This unique location means donors have options across state lines. Understanding your regional options can help maximize your earnings. The Ohio River forms the border with Ohio, while the Big Sandy River marks the Kentucky line - all within a short drive of downtown Huntington.</p>

                <div class="space-y-6">
                    <div class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900">Huntington, WV (Primary)</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Downtown Huntington has the main plasma center options including CSL Plasma. These centers cater heavily to Marshall University students and local residents. Convenient for most Huntington residents and easily accessible from I-64. The downtown and 4th Avenue corridor offers the most options. Centers here are familiar with the student population and often adjust their hours and promotions around the academic calendar. Parking is typically free or low-cost at strip mall locations. If you live in Huntington proper, these centers offer the best combination of convenience and competitive pay.</p>
                        <p class="text-green-600 text-sm">Average: $45-$65/visit | Most convenient option</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900">Ashland, KY (15-20 min)</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Just across the Big Sandy River in Kentucky, Ashland offers additional plasma center options. If Huntington centers have long waits or you work in Ashland, this can be a convenient alternative. Kentucky centers may have different promotional offers and operate under Kentucky state regulations. The drive is easy via US-60 or I-64, and Ashland's downtown area has several commercial strips with plasma center presence. If you work in the Ashland-Boyd County industrial corridor, donating during lunch or after work can be more convenient than backtracking to Huntington.</p>
                        <p class="text-green-600 text-sm">Average: $40-$60/visit | Good alternative option</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900">Ironton, OH (20-25 min)</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Across the Ohio River, Ironton may have plasma center options depending on current availability. Ohio centers may offer different rates and promotions. Worth checking if you commute to Ohio for work. The US-52 corridor along the Ohio River provides easy access. Lawrence County residents working in Huntington often find it convenient to donate on their commute. Ohio's larger population base sometimes means more center competition and better promotional offers - call ahead to compare rates before making the drive.</p>
                        <p class="text-green-600 text-sm">Average: $40-$55/visit | Check availability</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900">Charleston, WV (45-50 min)</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">The state capital has more plasma center options and sometimes higher pay rates due to larger population and competition. BioLife in Charleston often offers the best new donor bonuses in West Virginia. Worth the drive for new donors seeking maximum first-month earnings. Take I-64 East through the scenic Kanawha Valley. Charleston's larger market means more center options including BioLife, CSL Plasma, and others. For your first-month new donor bonus period (usually 8-10 visits), the extra $100-$200 total makes the Charleston commute worthwhile. After your promotional period, you can transfer to a closer Huntington location for regular donations.</p>

            <!-- Understanding Huntington's Plasma Market -->
            <section class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Huntington's Unique Plasma Market</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Huntington's plasma donation market is shaped by its university presence, Tri-State geography, and Appalachian economic conditions. Understanding these factors helps you maximize your earnings and navigate the local plasma landscape.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-3">Marshall University Student Community</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Marshall University brings thousands of students to Huntington each year, creating a significant donor population. Plasma centers near campus understand student schedules and often run promotions timed around the academic calendar. Watch for back-to-school bonuses in August/January and end-of-semester promotions when students need extra cash. The student demographic keeps wait times busier during typical class breaks (lunch hours, early evenings) but lighter during exam periods when students are studying. If you're a student, plasma donation provides steady income that works around class schedules - many students donate between classes or during study breaks.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-3">Economic Considerations</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Huntington area has experienced economic challenges with the decline of traditional industries. Plasma donation provides valuable supplemental income for many residents - $320-$450 monthly can significantly impact household budgets. Centers in the area understand this economic reality and typically maintain consistent hours and reliable payment. The community of regular donors is supportive and many return donors have been coming for years. Staff at local centers are often from the community and understand local circumstances.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-3">Tri-State Flexibility</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Living in the Tri-State area gives you unique options that most donors don't have. While you can only donate at one center at a time, you can compare rates across WV, KY, and OH before choosing where to register. Different states may have different promotional calendars, so timing your initial registration strategically can maximize your new donor bonus. Just remember that the national donor database tracks all donations regardless of state, so you cannot donate at multiple centers simultaneously.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-3">Seasonal Patterns</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Huntington's plasma market follows distinct seasonal patterns. Summer months see reduced student donors, sometimes leading to higher promotional offers to maintain supply. Winter brings weather challenges but also holiday promotions with bonus payments around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Spring brings the most consistent demand and moderate promotions. Plan your donation schedule around these patterns - starting as a new donor during high-bonus periods (summer, holidays) maximizes your initial earnings.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Your First Plasma Donation in Huntington: What to Expect</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">New to plasma donation? Here's a step-by-step guide to your first visit at a Huntington-area center. The initial appointment takes 2-3 hours, but subsequent visits are much faster (45-90 minutes).</p>

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-green-50">

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Many centers allow online pre-registration to save time. You'll enter basic information and schedule your appointment. Bring valid ID (WV, KY, or OH driver's license), Social Security card, and proof of address. Marshall students can use their campus address with appropriate documentation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="border rounded-lg p-4">

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Complete detailed health history questionnaires covering medical conditions, medications, travel history, and lifestyle factors. Be honest - these questions protect both you and the plasma recipients. Staff will verify your identity documents and enter you into the national donor database.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-green-50">

                        <p class="text-gray-700">First-time donors receive a physical exam including vital signs, weight measurement, and vein assessment. A medical professional will review your health history and ensure you're eligible to donate. This comprehensive exam only happens on your first visit.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">A finger-prick test checks your protein and hematocrit levels. You'll also have blood pressure, pulse, and temperature checked. This screening happens before every donation to ensure you're healthy enough to donate that day. Proper hydration helps you pass these checks easily.</p>

                    <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-green-50">

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Relax in a reclining chair while connected to the plasmapheresis machine. Blood is drawn, plasma separated, and red blood cells returned with saline. Huntington-area centers typically have WiFi, TVs, and comfortable seating. Bring your phone, headphones, or reading material. The process is painless after initial needle insertion.</p>

BioLife in Charleston (45 min away) offers up to $1,000 for new donors - worth the drive if you're starting out and want to maximize your first-month earnings. For regular donations after the new donor period, Huntington's CSL Plasma is more practical for most local residents.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">No, you can only be registered at one plasma center at a time. A national database (NDDR) tracks all plasma donations across the country. This protects donor health by ensuring no one donates too frequently. You can transfer between centers of the same company (like CSL to CSL), but switching to a different company requires completing their full new donor screening process. However, you won't get new donor bonuses again since you're already in the national database.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">Huntington plasma donors earn $40-$65 per donation, with new donors making $600-$900 in their first month through promotional bonuses. Monthly earnings average $320-$450 for twice-weekly donors donating consistently. Annual earnings can reach $4,000-$5,500 with consistent donations and promotional bonuses throughout the year. Pay varies by center, your weight (heavier donors can donate more plasma), and current promotional offers.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">Yes! Marshall students 18+ who meet health requirements are welcome to donate. Centers near campus often run student-specific promotions, especially at the start of semesters. You'll need proof of your Huntington address (dorm assignment letter, campus housing contract, or off-campus lease works) and a valid state ID from any state. Many students find plasma donation fits well between classes and provides steady spending money - $300-$450/month for a few hours weekly.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">For new donors, often yes. Charleston's BioLife offers $100-$200 more in total new donor bonuses over your first 8-10 visits. With gas around $3-4/gallon and the 90-mile round trip, you might spend $15-20 on gas per trip. If you're earning $10-$25 more per visit in Charleston during your new donor period, the math works out in your favor. For regular donations after your promotional period ends, the 90-minute round trip usually isn't worth the $5-$10 extra per visit - stick with convenient Huntington centers.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">You can donate at any center regardless of which state you live in. You'll need valid state ID (Kentucky or Ohio driver's license is fine) and proof of your current home address (utility bill, lease, bank statement). The center will verify your information through the national donor database. Many Tri-State area residents choose their plasma center based on convenience for their commute rather than which state it's in.</div>

This FDA regulation applies to all centers in Huntington and nationwide. Most regular donors establish a consistent schedule like Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Saturday. Donating consistently helps you qualify for loyalty bonuses and ensures steady income. Your body fully replaces donated plasma within 24-48 hours.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">Eat a protein-rich meal 2-3 hours before your donation. Good options include eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, beans, or Greek yogurt. Drink plenty of water - at least 64oz the day before and 16oz the morning of donation. Avoid fatty or fried foods which can make your plasma cloudy and potentially defer your donation. Skip alcohol for at least 24 hours before donating as it dehydrates you and affects plasma quality.</div>

                        <div class="p-4 pt-0 text-gray-700">Common temporary deferrals include recent tattoos/piercings (from unregulated facilities), travel to certain countries, recent illness, low protein/hematocrit levels, or certain medications. Permanent disqualifications include HIV/hepatitis, certain blood cancers, and IV drug use history. Pregnancy defers donation, but you can resume after delivery. Each center performs individual screening - being deferred at one visit doesn't mean permanent disqualification. Staff will explain any deferral reasons and when you can return.</div>
