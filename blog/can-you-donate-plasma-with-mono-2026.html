<h2 id="waiting">Waiting Period</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Can Donate?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Active infection</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Definitely wait</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Acute phase (2-4 weeks)</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Too sick</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Recovery (4-8 weeks)</strong></td><td>NO</td><td>Spleen still enlarged</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Full recovery</strong></td><td>YES</td><td>Symptoms completely gone</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Why You Must Wait</h2>
<p><strong>Several important reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enlarged spleen:</strong> Risk of rupture</li>
<li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Body needs energy to heal</li>
<li><strong>Viral shedding:</strong> May still be contagious</li>
<li><strong>Immune system:</strong> Needs resources to fight infection</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Spleen Concern</h2>
<p><strong>Critical safety issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mono enlarges spleen:</strong> Common symptom</li>
<li><strong>Rupture risk:</strong> Trauma can cause rupture</li>
<li><strong>Donation stress:</strong> Physical activity involved</li>
<li><strong>Wait until normal:</strong> Spleen should return to normal size</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recovery">Signs You're Ready</h2>
<p><strong>Before returning to donate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No fatigue:</strong> Energy levels normal</li>
<li><strong>No sore throat:</strong> Completely resolved</li>
<li><strong>No fever:</strong> Temperature normal</li>
<li><strong>No swollen glands:</strong> Lymph nodes normal</li>
<li><strong>Doctor clearance:</strong> If you had severe case</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Recovery Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Acute symptoms, bed rest</li>
<li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Symptoms improving</li>
<li><strong>Week 5-8:</strong> Gradual recovery, still fatigued</li>
<li><strong>Month 2-3:</strong> Most people fully recovered</li>
<li><strong>Some cases:</strong> Fatigue lasts months</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tips">Returning to Donation</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wait for full recovery:</strong> Don't rush back</li>
<li><strong>Energy normal:</strong> Not still tired</li>
<li><strong>Physical activity:</strong> Can exercise normally</li>
<li><strong>Spleen normal:</strong> No left-side pain</li>
<li><strong>Be honest:</strong> Tell center about recent mono</li>
<li><strong>Start slow:</strong> See how you feel after first donation</li>
</ol>

<h2>EBV After Recovery</h2>
<p><strong>Understanding the virus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stays dormant:</strong> EBV stays in body forever</li>
<li><strong>Usually inactive:</strong> No ongoing symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Very common:</strong> 90%+ of adults have EBV</li>
<li><strong>Can donate:</strong> Once acute infection resolved</li>
</ul>

<h2>History of Mono</h2>
<p><strong>If you had mono years ago:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not a problem:</strong> Past mono doesn't disqualify</li>
<li><strong>Common:</strong> Many adults had mono as teens</li>
<li><strong>No restrictions:</strong> If fully recovered long ago</li>
<li><strong>Don't need to mention:</strong> Unless very recent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>I was diagnosed with mono last week - how long until I can donate?</h3>
<p>You'll need to wait until you're fully recovered, which typically takes 4-8 weeks but can be longer. Your spleen needs to return to normal size and you should feel 100% - no fatigue, sore throat, or swollen glands. Don't rush back.</p>

<h3>I had mono as a teenager - does that affect my eligibility now?</h3>
<p>No, having had mono in the past doesn't affect your eligibility. Once you fully recovered from the acute infection, the past history doesn't matter. Most adults had EBV (mono virus) at some point and can donate normally.</p>

<h3>My mono symptoms are mostly gone but I'm still tired - can I donate?</h3>
<p>If you're still experiencing fatigue, it's best to wait. Mono fatigue can linger for weeks or even months after other symptoms resolve. Your body is still recovering, and donation could worsen your fatigue. Wait until you feel fully energized.</p>

<h3>Do I need a doctor's clearance after having mono?</h3>
<p>For a typical mono case, you don't necessarily need formal clearance - just wait until you're fully recovered. However, if you had a severe case, complications like an enlarged spleen, or were hospitalized, it's wise to check with your doctor before resuming donation.</p>

<h3>Why is mono different from a regular cold for donation?</h3>
<p>Mono involves significant impact on your spleen and immune system that a simple cold doesn't. The enlarged spleen risk and the prolonged fatigue mean your body needs more time to fully recover. A cold resolves in days; mono takes weeks to months.</p>

<div class="info-box"><div class="info-box-title">Recovery First</div><p>Mononucleosis requires complete recovery before plasma donation. The enlarged spleen risk and severe fatigue mean you need to wait until fully healed - typically 4-8 weeks or longer. Once recovered, you can donate normally.
