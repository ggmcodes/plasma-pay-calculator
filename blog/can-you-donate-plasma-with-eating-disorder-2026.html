            <!-- Introduction -->
            <div class="intro-section">
                <p class="lead">If you're considering plasma donation while managing an eating disorder or recovering from one, understanding the eligibility requirements is crucial for your safety and wellbeing. This comprehensive guide examines how eating disorders affect plasma donation eligibility, including specific considerations for different conditions, weight requirements, nutritional needs, and recovery status.</p>

                <p>Plasma donation centers have strict medical screening protocols designed to protect both donors and recipients. While these requirements may feel restrictive, they exist to ensure your health isn't compromised during the donation process. Let's explore what you need to know about plasma donation eligibility with eating disorders.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Understanding the Relationship -->
            <section>
                <h2>Understanding Plasma Donation and Eating Disorders</h2>

                <p>Plasma donation involves removing blood, separating the liquid plasma component, and returning red blood cells to your body. This process places specific demands on your body's nutritional reserves, hydration status, and overall health that can be particularly challenging for individuals with eating disorders.</p>

                <p>Eating disorders affect the body in ways that directly impact plasma donation eligibility:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein depletion:</strong> Plasma is approximately 90% water and 10% proteins. Your body needs adequate protein stores to safely replace donated plasma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrolyte imbalances:</strong> Many eating disorder behaviors disrupt electrolyte levels, which are critical for safe donation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Both restrictive eating and purging behaviors can cause chronic dehydration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrient deficiencies:</strong> Iron, B vitamins, and other nutrients essential for recovery after donation may be depleted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardiovascular stress:</strong> Low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and poor circulation complicate the donation process.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The relationship between plasma donation and eating disorders isn't about judgment. It's about medical safety. Donation centers must ensure the process won't exacerbate existing health challenges or trigger a relapse in recovery.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- General Eligibility Overview -->
            <section>
                <h2>General Plasma Donation Eligibility Requirements</h2>

                <p>Before examining eating disorder-specific considerations, it's important to understand the baseline requirements for all plasma donors in 2026:</p>

                <div class="eligibility-checklist">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18-69 (some centers allow up to 74)</li>
                        <li>Weight at least 110 pounds (some centers require 120+)</li>
                        <li>Generally healthy with no active infections</li>
                        <li>Normal vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature)</li>
                        <li>Adequate protein levels (total protein 6.0-8.3 g/dL)</li>
                        <li>Sufficient hemoglobin/hematocrit levels</li>
                        <li>Proper hydration</li>
                        <li>Valid government-issued photo ID</li>
                        <li>Proof of Social Security number or border crossing card</li>
                        <li>Proof of current address</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>These requirements serve as the foundation for safe donation. Individuals with eating disorders often struggle to meet several of these criteria, particularly weight, vital signs, protein levels, and hydration requirements.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Condition-Specific Information -->
            <section>
                <h2>Eligibility by Eating Disorder Type</h2>

                <p>Different eating disorders affect the body in distinct ways, creating unique challenges for plasma donation eligibility. Here's what you need to know about each condition.</p>

                <h3>Anorexia Nervosa and Plasma Donation</h3>

                <p>Anorexia nervosa presents significant barriers to plasma donation eligibility due to its impact on body weight, nutritional status, and overall health.</p>

                <div class="condition-details">
                    <p><strong>Active Anorexia:</strong> Individuals with active anorexia nervosa are typically ineligible for plasma donation due to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Insufficient weight:</strong> Most individuals with active anorexia cannot meet the 110-pound minimum weight requirement</li>
                        <li><strong>Severe protein deficiency:</strong> Restrictive eating depletes protein stores needed to replace donated plasma</li>
                        <li><strong>Low blood pressure:</strong> Hypotension is common in anorexia and can cause dangerous complications during donation</li>
                        <li><strong>Bradycardia:</strong> Abnormally slow heart rate may disqualify donors</li>
                        <li><strong>Electrolyte imbalances:</strong> Can lead to cardiac complications during the donation process</li>
                        <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> Low hemoglobin levels prevent donation and are worsened by plasma removal</li>
                        <li><strong>Immune compromise:</strong> Malnutrition weakens immune function, increasing infection risk</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Recovery Status:</strong> Those in recovery from anorexia may become eligible to donate once they have:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintained weight above 110 pounds for at least 6 months</li>
                        <li>Achieved stable vital signs within normal ranges</li>
                        <li>Demonstrated consistent adequate nutrition</li>
                        <li>Normalized lab values (protein, electrolytes, blood counts)</li>
                        <li>Received medical clearance from their treatment team</li>
                        <li>Shown no evidence of ongoing restriction or compensatory behaviors</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Bulimia Nervosa and Plasma Donation</h3>

                <p>Bulimia nervosa involves cycles of binge eating followed by purging behaviors that create specific health risks for plasma donation.</p>

                <div class="condition-details">
                    <p><strong>Active Bulimia:</strong> Active bulimia typically disqualifies individuals from plasma donation because:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Electrolyte disturbances:</strong> Purging causes dangerous imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride</li>
                        <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Both chronic and acute dehydration from purging makes donation unsafe</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiac arrhythmias:</strong> Electrolyte imbalances increase risk of irregular heartbeat during donation</li>
                        <li><strong>Nutritional deficiencies:</strong> Despite adequate or above-normal weight, nutrient absorption may be impaired</li>
                        <li><strong>Blood pressure fluctuations:</strong> Purging behaviors can cause unstable blood pressure</li>
                        <li><strong>Gastrointestinal complications:</strong> Esophageal damage and other GI issues may complicate recovery from donation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Recovery Eligibility:</strong> Individuals in recovery from bulimia may donate if they have:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Abstained from all purging behaviors for at least 6 months</li>
                        <li>Normal and stable electrolyte levels</li>
                        <li>Adequate hydration status</li>
                        <li>Normal vital signs and lab values</li>
                        <li>Medical clearance from healthcare providers</li>
                        <li>Stable eating patterns without binge episodes</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Plasma Donation</h3>

                <p>Binge eating disorder presents different challenges for plasma donation eligibility compared to restrictive or purging disorders.</p>

            <!-- Weight Requirements -->
            <section>
                <h2>Weight Requirements and Eating Disorders</h2>

                <p>Weight requirements for plasma donation exist for medical safety, not arbitrary reasons. The minimum weight of 110 pounds (some centers require 120 pounds) is based on the volume of plasma that can be safely removed relative to body size.</p>

                <h3>Why Weight Matters for Plasma Donation</h3>

                <p>Plasma centers calculate donation volume based on donor weight:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>110-149 pounds:</strong> Approximately 690-825 mL of plasma removed</li>
                    <li><strong>150-174 pounds:</strong> Approximately 825-880 mL of plasma removed</li>
                    <li><strong>175+ pounds:</strong> Up to 880-900 mL of plasma removed (maximum)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Removing too much plasma relative to body weight creates dangerous fluid and protein depletion. For individuals with eating disorders, this risk is amplified because nutritional reserves are already compromised.</p>

                <h3>Weight Stability Requirements</h3>

                <p>For donors with a history of eating disorders, weight stability is as important as meeting the minimum:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stable for 6+ months:</strong> Demonstrates sustained recovery and metabolic normalization</li>
                    <li><strong>No rapid fluctuations:</strong> Frequent weight changes indicate ongoing disordered eating behaviors</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate for height:</strong> BMI considerations beyond just hitting minimum weight</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintained without compensatory behaviors:</strong> Weight achieved through balanced eating, not restriction or purging</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box" style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you're at or just above the minimum weight requirement and have a history of eating disorders, plasma donation may pose serious health risks. The physical stress of donation could trigger weight loss or relapse. Consult your treatment team before proceeding.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Nutritional Considerations -->
            <section>
                <h2>Nutritional Requirements for Safe Donation</h2>

                <p>Plasma donation places significant nutritional demands on your body. For individuals with eating disorders or eating disorder history, meeting these demands requires special attention.</p>

                <h3>Protein Requirements</h3>

                <p>Protein is the most critical nutrient for plasma donation because plasma consists largely of protein. Your body must have adequate protein stores to regenerate donated plasma.</p>

                <div class="nutrition-requirements">
                    <p><strong>Minimum Daily Protein for Donors:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Women:</strong> 50-60 grams per day minimum (more for frequent donors)</li>
                        <li><strong>Men:</strong> 60-75 grams per day minimum</li>
                        <li><strong>On donation days:</strong> 20-30 grams of high-quality protein within 2 hours of donating</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Protein Sources:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lean meats, poultry, fish (20-30g per 4 oz serving)</li>
                        <li>Eggs (6g per large egg)</li>
                        <li>Greek yogurt (15-20g per cup)</li>
                        <li>Legumes and beans (15-18g per cup cooked)</li>
                        <li>Nuts and nut butters (6-8g per 2 tablespoons)</li>
                        <li>Protein shakes or supplements if needed</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>For individuals recovering from restrictive eating disorders, meeting protein requirements may require intentional meal planning and possibly supplementation under medical supervision.</p>

                <h3>Hydration Requirements</h3>

                <p>Proper hydration is essential for safe plasma donation. Dehydration makes veins harder to access, slows the donation process, and increases the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

                <div class="nutrition-requirements">
                    <p><strong>Hydration Guidelines for Plasma Donors:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daily baseline:</strong> 64-80 ounces of water</li>
                        <li><strong>Day before donation:</strong> 80-100 ounces of water</li>
                        <li><strong>Day of donation:</strong> 16-20 ounces 2 hours before, plus 8-16 ounces immediately after</li>
                        <li><strong>After donation:</strong> Extra 32 ounces throughout the day</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Special Considerations for Eating Disorders:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Those with purging behaviors may struggle with chronic dehydration</li>
                        <li>Some individuals restrict fluids to manipulate weight</li>
                        <li>ARFID may include aversion to drinking plain water</li>
                        <li>Electrolyte imbalances affect fluid retention and hydration status</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Iron and Other Micronutrients</h3>

                <p>While plasma donation doesn't remove as much iron as whole blood donation, maintaining adequate iron levels remains important, especially for frequent donors.</p>

                <div class="nutrition-requirements">
                    <p><strong>Essential Micronutrients:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Ferritin should be above 12 ng/mL for women, 20 ng/mL for men</li>
                        <li><strong>Vitamin B12:</strong> Critical for red blood cell production and recovery</li>
                        <li><strong>Folate:</strong> Works with B12 for cell regeneration</li>
                        <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Enhances iron absorption and immune function</li>
                        <li><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D:</strong> May be bound by anticoagulant during donation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Eating disorders frequently cause deficiencies in these nutrients, making supplementation and dietary variety essential for safe donation.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Recovery Status -->
            <section>
                <h2>Plasma Donation During Eating Disorder Recovery</h2>

                <p>Recovery from an eating disorder is a complex process that involves physical, psychological, and behavioral healing. The decision to donate plasma during recovery should be made carefully with input from your treatment team.</p>

                <h3>When Recovery May Support Donation Eligibility</h3>

                <p>You may be ready to consider plasma donation if you've achieved:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medical stability:</strong> At least 6 months of stable vital signs, normal lab values, and appropriate weight</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral stability:</strong> No restriction, purging, excessive exercise, or other compensatory behaviors</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutritional adequacy:</strong> Consistent adequate intake of all macronutrients and micronutrients</li>
                    <li><strong>Psychological readiness:</strong> Reduced preoccupation with food, weight, and body image</li>
                    <li><strong>Support system:</strong> Active engagement with treatment team and recovery supports</li>
                    <li><strong>Coping skills:</strong> Healthy strategies for managing stress and emotions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risks of Donating Too Early in Recovery</h3>

                <p>Attempting to donate plasma before you're fully stable in recovery can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Trigger relapse into restrictive eating or purging behaviors</li>
                    <li>Exacerbate nutritional deficiencies and delay healing</li>
                    <li>Cause physical complications due to compromised health</li>
                    <li>Reinforce unhealthy focus on body and weight</li>
                    <li>Create financial pressure that undermines recovery priorities</li>
                    <li>Overwhelm fragile coping mechanisms with physical stress</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>Critical Warning:</strong> If you're considering plasma donation primarily for the monetary compensation, and this feels driven by eating disorder thoughts or financial stress related to your disorder, please reach out to your treatment team or NEDA (1-800-931-2237) before proceeding. Your recovery is more valuable than any payment.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Questions to Ask Your Treatment Team</h3>

                <p>Before pursuing plasma donation, discuss these questions with your healthcare providers:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Am I medically stable enough for the physical demands of plasma donation?</li>
                    <li>Are my lab values (protein, electrolytes, blood counts) adequate for safe donation?</li>
                    <li>Could the stress of donation trigger behavioral or psychological relapse?</li>
                    <li>Do I have adequate nutritional reserves to replace donated plasma?</li>
                    <li>Are there specific health markers we should monitor if I proceed with donation?</li>
                    <li>What warning signs should I watch for that would indicate donation is affecting my recovery?</li>
                    <li>How long should I wait between donations to protect my health?</li>
                    <li>Are there alternative ways to meet my financial needs that pose less risk to my recovery?</li>
                </ol>

            <!-- Medical Screening Process -->
            <section>
                <h2>What to Expect During Medical Screening</h2>

                <p>Plasma centers conduct thorough medical screening for all donors. Understanding this process helps you prepare and determine if disclosure of your eating disorder history is necessary.</p>

                <h3>Initial Health Questionnaire</h3>

                <p>Your first visit includes a detailed health questionnaire covering:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Medical history and current conditions</li>
                    <li>Medications and supplements</li>
                    <li>Recent illnesses or hospitalizations</li>
                    <li>Lifestyle factors affecting health</li>
                    <li>Mental health history</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You may encounter questions about eating disorders, weight changes, or nutritional status. Answer honestly to ensure your safety.</p>

                <h3>Physical Examination</h3>

                <p>Each donation includes vital sign checks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood pressure:</strong> Must be 90/50 to 180/100 mmHg</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulse:</strong> Typically 50-100 beats per minute</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Below 99.5°F</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Verified at each visit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Abnormal vital signs common in eating disorders (low blood pressure, slow or irregular pulse) will result in deferral.</p>

                <h3>Laboratory Testing</h3>

                <p>Blood samples are tested for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total protein:</strong> Must be 6.0-8.3 g/dL</li>
                    <li><strong>Hemoglobin/hematocrit:</strong> Minimum varies by gender and center</li>
                    <li><strong>Infectious disease markers:</strong> HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Low protein levels often result from eating disorders and will disqualify you from donation until they normalize.</p>

                <h3>Should You Disclose Your Eating Disorder?</h3>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you donate plasma if you have anorexia nervosa?</h3>
                    <p>Individuals with active anorexia nervosa typically cannot donate plasma due to weight requirements and nutritional deficiencies. Plasma centers require donors to weigh at least 110 pounds, and anorexia often causes severe protein and nutrient deficiencies that make donation unsafe. Those in recovery may qualify once they've achieved stable weight, normal vital signs, and adequate nutrition for at least 6 months.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does bulimia disqualify you from plasma donation?</h3>
                    <p>Active bulimia nervosa can disqualify you from plasma donation due to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and nutritional deficiencies caused by purging behaviors. These conditions make plasma donation unsafe. Individuals in stable recovery with normal lab values, adequate hydration, and no purging behaviors for several months may be eligible to donate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I donate plasma if I'm recovering from an eating disorder?</h3>
                    <p>You may be eligible to donate plasma during eating disorder recovery if you meet specific criteria: stable weight for at least 6 months, meeting minimum weight requirements (110+ pounds), normal vital signs and lab values, adequate protein and nutrient intake, medical clearance from your treatment team, and no recent symptoms or behaviors. Always consult your healthcare provider before attempting to donate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What nutritional requirements must be met to donate plasma with a history of eating disorders?</h3>
                    <p>To safely donate plasma with a history of eating disorders, you must maintain adequate protein intake (50-60g daily minimum), stay well-hydrated (64+ ounces of water daily), have normal iron levels (ferritin above 12 ng/mL for women, 20 ng/mL for men), maintain sufficient total protein (6.0-8.3 g/dL), keep normal albumin levels (3.5-5.5 g/dL), and demonstrate stable eating patterns without restriction or purging.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I tell the plasma center about my eating disorder history?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you should disclose your eating disorder history to the plasma center. This information helps medical staff assess your eligibility safely and monitor for any complications. Plasma centers are bound by HIPAA privacy laws and will keep your information confidential. Withholding this information could put your health at serious risk during the donation process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long after eating disorder treatment can I donate plasma?</h3>
                    <p>Most healthcare providers recommend waiting at least 6-12 months after completing intensive eating disorder treatment before considering plasma donation. This timeline allows for medical stabilization, weight stability, nutritional recovery, and psychological readiness. The exact timeline depends on your individual recovery progress and should be determined with your treatment team.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can plasma donation trigger an eating disorder relapse?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, plasma donation can potentially trigger eating disorder relapse, especially if you're early in recovery. The focus on weight requirements, physical changes after donation, and financial incentives may activate disordered thoughts or behaviors. Warning signs include restricting food before weigh-ins, obsessing over weight changes, feeling guilty about eating after donation, or using donation as compensation for eating.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my weight is exactly at the 110-pound minimum?</h3>
                    <p>If you're at or just above the 110-pound minimum weight requirement, plasma donation may not be safe, especially with eating disorder history. Being at the minimum means your body has minimal reserves to replace donated plasma. Weight fluctuations from normal daily variation could put you below the threshold. Discuss this with your healthcare provider before proceeding, as donation at this weight carries higher risks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are there alternatives to plasma donation for earning money?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, there are many alternatives that may be safer for individuals with eating disorder history: participating in paid research studies (not health-related), selling unused items online, freelancing skills you already have, gig economy work (delivery, task services), tutoring, pet sitting, or seeking financial assistance programs. Your treatment team or social worker can help identify resources that don't pose health risks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What blood tests should I have before donating with eating disorder history?</h3>
                    <p>Before attempting plasma donation with eating disorder history, ask your doctor for these tests: comprehensive metabolic panel (electrolytes, kidney function, protein levels), complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets), iron studies (serum iron, ferritin, TIBC), vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function tests. These provide a complete picture of your nutritional status and readiness for donation.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <section class="conclusion-section">
                <h2>Your Health Comes First</h2>

                <p>The decision to donate plasma when you have or have had an eating disorder is not simple. While some individuals in stable, long-term recovery can donate safely, many cannot do so without risking their health or recovery progress.</p>

                <p>Remember these key points:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Active eating disorders typically disqualify you from plasma donation due to medical safety concerns</li>
                    <li>Recovery must be stable for at least 6 months before considering donation</li>
                    <li>Meeting weight minimums doesn't automatically mean donation is safe for your body</li>
                    <li>Nutritional demands of donation can be challenging with eating disorder history</li>
                    <li>Honest disclosure to medical professionals protects your health</li>
                    <li>Your treatment team's guidance should take priority over financial incentives</li>
                    <li>Alternative income sources may better support your recovery</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you're struggling with the decision or feeling pressured by financial need, please reach out to support resources. The NEDA Hotline (1-800-931-2237) can connect you with resources for both eating disorder support and financial assistance.</p>

                <p>Your recovery is invaluable. No payment for plasma donation is worth risking the progress you've made or the health you're working to rebuild.</p>
