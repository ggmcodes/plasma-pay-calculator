<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p><strong>Yes, most people with herpes can donate plasma.</strong> Both HSV-1 (oral herpes / cold sores) and HSV-2 (genital herpes) are accepted at all major plasma centers, as long as you have no active outbreak at the time of donation. Antiviral medications like Valtrex and acyclovir are also accepted. The only deferral trigger is an active lesion, open sore, or visible outbreak &mdash; once it is fully healed, you can donate again.</p></div>

<p>If you have herpes and want to donate plasma, you are far from alone. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 67% of the global population under age 50 has HSV-1, and about 13% has HSV-2. That is billions of people &mdash; and a huge number of current and potential plasma donors.</p>

<p>Yet the stigma surrounding herpes means many potential donors never walk through the door. They assume they will be turned away, or worse, humiliated during screening. The reality is much more straightforward than most people expect.</p>

<p>This guide covers exactly what you need to know: which types of herpes affect eligibility, what happens during screening, which medications are accepted, and how each major plasma center handles herpes in 2026.</p>

<h2 id="hsv1-vs-hsv2">HSV-1 vs HSV-2: Donation Eligibility Breakdown</h2>

<p>Herpes simplex virus comes in two forms, and understanding the difference matters for plasma donation &mdash; though perhaps not as much as you would think.</p>

<h3>HSV-1 (Oral Herpes / Cold Sores)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> The virus responsible for cold sores and fever blisters, typically appearing on or around the lips</li>
<li><strong>How common:</strong> Approximately 3.7 billion people worldwide under age 50 have HSV-1 &mdash; that is about 50-80% of U.S. adults</li>
<li><strong>Donation eligibility:</strong> Yes, when no active cold sore is present</li>
<li><strong>Deferral trigger:</strong> Only an active, visible cold sore at the time of your appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>HSV-1 is so common that plasma centers would lose the majority of their donor pool if they excluded everyone who carries the virus. Most people contract it in childhood through non-sexual contact like a kiss from a relative or sharing utensils.</p>

<h3>HSV-2 (Genital Herpes)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> The virus most commonly associated with genital herpes outbreaks</li>
<li><strong>How common:</strong> Approximately 491 million people aged 15-49 worldwide have HSV-2, including about 12% of U.S. adults</li>
<li><strong>Donation eligibility:</strong> Yes, at most centers, when no active outbreak is present</li>
<li><strong>Deferral trigger:</strong> Active genital lesions or sores, or signs of current systemic infection (fever, malaise associated with an outbreak)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key point for both types: <strong>herpes is not on the FDA's list of permanent deferral conditions for plasma donation.</strong> The FDA regulates source plasma collection in the United States, and their guidance focuses on active infections that could compromise donor health or product safety &mdash; not on dormant viral carriers.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Factor</th><th>HSV-1 (Cold Sores)</th><th>HSV-2 (Genital)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Can you donate?</td><td>Yes, when dormant</td><td>Yes, when dormant</td></tr>
<tr><td>Active outbreak deferral?</td><td>Yes &mdash; temporary</td><td>Yes &mdash; temporary</td></tr>
<tr><td>Permanent deferral?</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tested during screening?</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Antivirals accepted?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Affects pay rate?</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="active-vs-dormant">Active Outbreak vs Dormant Virus: The Only Thing That Matters</h2>

<p>This is the single most important distinction for plasma donation with herpes. Centers do not care whether you carry the virus. They care whether you have an active outbreak <em>right now</em>.</p>

<h3>Why Active Outbreaks Cause Deferral</h3>
<p>When herpes is active, three things happen that concern plasma centers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher viral load in blood:</strong> During an active outbreak, HSV can be detected in the bloodstream at higher levels than during dormancy. While the risk of transmission through plasma products is still extremely low, centers err on the side of caution.</li>
<li><strong>Compromised immune system:</strong> An active outbreak signals that your immune system is currently fighting the virus. Plasma donation removes antibodies and proteins from your blood, which could slow your recovery and make you feel worse.</li>
<li><strong>Open wound risk:</strong> If lesions are near the venipuncture site (the arm), there is a theoretical contamination risk. Even if lesions are elsewhere on the body, centers typically defer during any active outbreak.</li>
</ol>

<h3>When the Virus Is Dormant</h3>
<p>Between outbreaks, HSV retreats to nerve ganglia and becomes largely undetectable in the blood. During this dormant phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viral shedding in blood is negligible or nonexistent</li>
<li>Your immune system is not actively fighting a flare</li>
<li>There are no open wounds or lesions</li>
<li>You are medically indistinguishable from a non-carrier for donation purposes</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>The Simple Rule</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active outbreak = temporary deferral</strong> (come back when healed)</li>
<li><strong>No active outbreak = eligible to donate</strong> (no restrictions)</li>
<li><strong>Taking antivirals with no outbreak = eligible to donate</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="antivirals">Antiviral Medications and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Many people with herpes take daily antiviral medication to suppress outbreaks. The good news: these medications are fully accepted at all major plasma centers.</p>

<h3>Accepted Antiviral Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Medication</th><th>Brand Name</th><th>Accepted?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Valacyclovir</td><td>Valtrex</td><td>Yes</td><td>Most commonly prescribed for herpes suppression</td></tr>
<tr><td>Acyclovir</td><td>Zovirax</td><td>Yes</td><td>Older antiviral, still widely used</td></tr>
<tr><td>Famciclovir</td><td>Famvir</td><td>Yes</td><td>Less common but fully accepted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Penciclovir cream</td><td>Denavir</td><td>Yes</td><td>Topical treatment for cold sores</td></tr>
<tr><td>Docosanol cream</td><td>Abreva</td><td>Yes</td><td>OTC cold sore treatment</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>These antivirals work by inhibiting viral replication. They do not affect your blood composition, plasma quality, or the safety of plasma products in any way that concerns collection centers. In fact, donors who take suppressive antivirals are often <em>better</em> candidates because they experience fewer outbreaks and can donate more consistently.</p>

<h3>Important Notes About Antivirals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>You do not need to stop taking them before donating.</strong> Continue your normal medication schedule.</li>
<li><strong>You should mention them during screening</strong> when asked about current medications. Staff will confirm they are accepted and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Taking antivirals for an active outbreak is different.</strong> If you just started a course to treat a current flare-up, you will need to wait until the outbreak resolves before donating &mdash; the medication itself is fine, but the active outbreak is the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Topical treatments</strong> (Abreva, Denavir) applied to an active cold sore still mean you have an active outbreak &mdash; the medication itself is fine, but the outbreak is the deferral trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-counts">What Counts as an "Active Outbreak" for Screening Purposes</h2>

<p>This is where many donors get confused. Plasma center staff are looking for specific signs during your physical check-in. Understanding what they consider "active" helps you know when to schedule your appointments and when to stay home.</p>

<h3>Signs That Will Defer You</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visible blisters or vesicles</strong> &mdash; anywhere on the body, including lips, face, or genitals</li>
<li><strong>Open sores or ulcers</strong> &mdash; lesions that have ruptured but not yet healed</li>
<li><strong>Crusting or scabbing</strong> &mdash; sores in the healing phase are still considered active by most centers</li>
<li><strong>Redness and swelling</strong> at a known outbreak site that appears to be a new or developing lesion</li>
<li><strong>Prodromal symptoms you report</strong> &mdash; if you tell staff you feel tingling, burning, or itching that typically precedes your outbreaks, they may defer you as a precaution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs That Will NOT Defer You</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully healed skin</strong> &mdash; no redness, scabbing, or open areas remaining</li>
<li><strong>Old scarring</strong> from previous outbreaks</li>
<li><strong>Asymptomatic viral shedding</strong> &mdash; this is not detectable during a physical exam and does not trigger deferral</li>
<li><strong>A history of herpes</strong> with no current symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation</strong> &mdash; darkened skin where a previous outbreak occurred, but fully healed</li>
<li><strong>Dry, chapped lips</strong> without actual cold sore blisters</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Pro Tip</h3>
<p>If you are unsure whether a sore is fully healed, wait an extra few days. Showing up with a questionable lesion means the staff member has to make a judgment call, and they will almost always err on the side of deferral. Better to wait two more days than to waste a trip to the center.</p>

<h2 id="wait-time">How Long to Wait After an Outbreak Resolves</h2>

<p>Once your outbreak has cleared, you still need to wait for complete healing before donating. Here is a general timeline based on how herpes outbreaks typically progress:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Healing Stage</th><th>Typical Timeline</th><th>Can You Donate?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Active blisters / vesicles</td><td>Days 1-4</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open sores / ulcers</td><td>Days 3-7</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Crusting / scabbing</td><td>Days 5-10</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scab falls off, pink skin visible</td><td>Days 8-14</td><td>Maybe &mdash; depends on center</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fully healed, normal skin tone</td><td>Days 10-21</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Center-Specific Wait Times</h3>
<p>Most centers use a general guideline rather than a strict day count. The universal rule is: <strong>all lesions must be completely healed with no scabbing, crusting, or open skin.</strong> In practice, this typically means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum 7 days</strong> after the last sore has fully closed (for mild, localized outbreaks)</li>
<li><strong>14 days</strong> is the most commonly cited wait period at major chains</li>
<li><strong>Some centers</strong> may simply ask you to wait until your next scheduled donation window (3-7 days after your last eligible date)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your outbreak was accompanied by fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, or other systemic symptoms, centers may want you to wait longer &mdash; until you feel completely back to normal, not just until the sores themselves have healed.</p>

<h3>Tips for Faster Healing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start antiviral treatment early:</strong> Taking Valtrex or acyclovir at the first sign of tingling can shorten an outbreak by 1-2 days</li>
<li><strong>Keep the area clean and dry:</strong> Helps prevent secondary infection that slows healing</li>
<li><strong>Avoid touching or picking at sores:</strong> This prolongs the healing process and can spread the virus to other areas</li>
<li><strong>Get adequate sleep and manage stress:</strong> Both support immune function and faster recovery</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-by-Center Policies on Herpes</h2>

<p>While the core rule is the same everywhere (no active outbreaks), each major plasma company has slightly different procedures for how they handle herpes during screening. Here is what to expect at each one.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>HSV-1 / Cold Sores</th><th>HSV-2 / Genital</th><th>Antivirals Accepted?</th><th>Wait After Outbreak</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CSL Plasma</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
<tr><td>BioLife Plasma</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octapharma Plasma</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grifols / BPL Plasma</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
<tr><td>KEDPLASMA</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Interstate Blood Bank</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Accepted when healed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Until fully healed</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>As you can see, the policies are remarkably consistent across the industry. No major U.S. plasma center permanently defers donors for herpes. The variation tends to come down to individual staff members and how strictly they interpret "fully healed" during your physical screening.</p>

<h3>What to Expect at Screening</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Health questionnaire:</strong> You will answer questions about current infections, medications, and overall health. Most questionnaires do not specifically ask "Do you have herpes?" They ask about current symptoms, open sores, and active infections.</li>
<li><strong>Physical exam:</strong> A staff member checks your arms for suitable veins and injection site condition, looks at your general appearance, and checks vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse). They will notice visible cold sores on your lips but typically will not examine other body areas unless you report symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Medication review:</strong> You will list current medications. Antivirals will be noted, checked against the approved list, and approved without issue.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="oral-vs-genital">Genital Herpes vs Oral Herpes &mdash; Different Treatment by Centers?</h2>

<p>In theory, plasma centers treat HSV-1 and HSV-2 identically: no active outbreak means you can donate. In practice, there are a few subtle differences in how the two are handled during the screening process.</p>

<h3>Oral Herpes (Cold Sores) &mdash; HSV-1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Cold sores on the lips are immediately visible to screening staff. This means even a minor cold sore will be spotted during your physical check and will trigger deferral without you needing to say anything.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Because cold sores are so common, staff members see them regularly and handle them matter-of-factly. There is minimal awkwardness or judgment involved.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> You do not need to volunteer your HSV-1 status if no cold sore is present. If one is visible, staff will simply note it and ask you to come back when it has healed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Genital Herpes &mdash; HSV-2</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Screening staff do not examine genital areas. Genital outbreaks are only flagged if you disclose them on the questionnaire or during the health interview.</li>
<li><strong>Self-reporting:</strong> This means genital herpes eligibility relies more heavily on honest self-reporting. If you have an active genital outbreak and do not disclose it, staff likely will not discover it during the screening &mdash; but donating during an active outbreak is not recommended for your own health and recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Stigma factor:</strong> Some donors feel uncomfortable disclosing genital herpes. The important thing to know is that staff are medical professionals who handle sensitive health information daily. Your disclosure will be handled confidentially and without judgment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>From a medical and policy standpoint, the distinction between oral and genital herpes does not matter for plasma donation. The only thing that matters is whether you currently have an active outbreak. Both types are treated the same way: temporary deferral during active outbreaks, full eligibility when the virus is dormant.</p>

<h2 id="science">The Science: Why Herpes in Plasma Matters (Or Doesn't)</h2>

<p>Understanding the science behind the policy helps explain why plasma centers are comfortable accepting donors with herpes &mdash; and why the deferral rules are structured the way they are.</p>

<h3>How HSV Behaves in Blood</h3>
<p>Herpes simplex virus is primarily a mucocutaneous pathogen &mdash; meaning it infects skin and mucous membranes. It is not a blood-borne virus in the way that HIV or hepatitis is. Here is what happens in the body at each stage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>During dormancy:</strong> HSV hides in nerve ganglia (clusters of nerve cells near the spine). It is essentially undetectable in blood plasma during this phase. The virus is physically sequestered in nerve tissue, far from the bloodstream.</li>
<li><strong>During outbreaks:</strong> The virus reactivates and travels along nerves to the skin surface. Some viral particles do enter the bloodstream (a state called viremia), but at much lower levels than truly blood-borne viruses like HIV or hepatitis C.</li>
<li><strong>Asymptomatic shedding:</strong> The virus can occasionally be shed from skin even without visible sores. This shedding involves skin cells and mucosal surfaces, not significant amounts of virus in the blood, and it does not meaningfully affect plasma safety.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plasma Processing Eliminates Risk</h3>
<p>Even if trace amounts of HSV were present in donated plasma, the manufacturing process provides multiple layers of protection before the plasma reaches any patient:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pathogen inactivation:</strong> Plasma-derived products undergo solvent/detergent treatment or pasteurization that inactivates enveloped viruses like HSV. The lipid envelope that surrounds HSV is particularly vulnerable to these processes.</li>
<li><strong>Nanofiltration:</strong> Manufacturing steps that filter plasma through extremely fine membranes can physically remove viral particles based on size.</li>
<li><strong>Pooling and dilution:</strong> Plasma from individual donors is pooled with thousands of other donations, diluting any viral material to negligible concentrations even before inactivation steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>The combination of low viremia during dormancy, effective plasma processing, and the non-blood-borne nature of HSV means the risk of HSV transmission through plasma products is effectively zero. This is precisely why the FDA does not require herpes testing for plasma donors and does not list herpes as a permanent deferral condition.</p>

<h3>Why Centers Still Defer During Active Outbreaks</h3>
<p>If the risk is so low, why defer during outbreaks at all? Three practical reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donor safety comes first:</strong> Donating plasma temporarily reduces your immune function by removing immunoglobulins (antibodies). Doing so while your body is actively fighting a viral flare can worsen or prolong your outbreak and leave you feeling depleted.</li>
<li><strong>Precautionary principle:</strong> Viral load in blood is measurably higher during outbreaks. While risk to plasma recipients is minimal, eliminating it entirely aligns with good manufacturing practice.</li>
<li><strong>Open wound and infection concern:</strong> Any open sore, regardless of cause, creates a potential entry point for bacteria at the needle insertion site or poses a cross-contamination concern in the clinical environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stigma">Stigma and Disclosure at Screening</h2>

<p>This is the section many readers came here for. The fear of judgment at a plasma center keeps a lot of people from donating &mdash; or from being honest during screening. Here is what actually happens in practice.</p>

<h3>What the Questionnaire Actually Asks</h3>
<p>Standard plasma donation health questionnaires typically include questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Do you have any active infections today?"</li>
<li>"Do you have any open sores, cuts, or wounds on your body?"</li>
<li>"Are you currently feeling ill or experiencing any symptoms of illness?"</li>
<li>"Please list all medications you are currently taking."</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice what is <em>not</em> on that list: "Do you have herpes?" or "Have you ever been diagnosed with HSV?" Most plasma center questionnaires do not ask about herpes by name. They ask about current symptoms that would apply to any health condition.</p>

<h3>How to Handle Disclosure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No active outbreak, no symptoms:</strong> If you have no current symptoms, answer the health questions honestly based on your current state. You are not currently experiencing an active infection, you have no open sores, and you are not feeling ill. Your latent herpes status is medically irrelevant in this scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Active outbreak present:</strong> Be honest and straightforward. Tell the screener you have an active cold sore or herpes outbreak. They will note it, issue a temporary deferral, and tell you to come back when it has healed. It is routine and handled without fanfare.</li>
<li><strong>Taking daily antivirals:</strong> List them with your other medications when asked. The screener will check them against the center's approved medication list, confirm they are accepted, and move on. This takes about five seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff Professionalism</h3>
<p>Plasma center staff are trained medical professionals who screen hundreds of donors every week. They deal with far more sensitive health disclosures than herpes on a daily basis &mdash; including questions about IV drug use, HIV status, sexual history, and incarceration. From their perspective, herpes is one of the most routine, unremarkable conditions they encounter. It ranks somewhere between "I have seasonal allergies" and "I take blood pressure medication" in terms of how notable it is to them.</p>

<p>If a staff member ever makes you feel judged or uncomfortable about a herpes disclosure, that represents a failure of professionalism on their part &mdash; not a reflection of any center policy. You have every right to request a different screener or to speak with the center manager.</p>

<h2 id="other-stis">Other STIs and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Since we are on the topic, here is how other sexually transmitted infections affect plasma donation eligibility. This context is useful if you have questions about STI-related deferrals more broadly.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>STI</th><th>Can You Donate?</th><th>Deferral Type</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>HSV-1 (Cold Sores)</td><td>Yes, when dormant</td><td>Temporary (active outbreak only)</td><td>Resume after full healing</td></tr>
<tr><td>HSV-2 (Genital Herpes)</td><td>Yes, when dormant</td><td>Temporary (active outbreak only)</td><td>Resume after full healing</td></tr>
<tr><td>HPV (Human Papillomavirus)</td><td>Yes</td><td>None (unless active genital warts)</td><td>HPV itself does not affect plasma safety</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chlamydia</td><td>After treatment</td><td>Temporary</td><td>Must complete full antibiotic course and be symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gonorrhea</td><td>After treatment</td><td>Temporary</td><td>Must complete full antibiotic course and be symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Syphilis</td><td>Depends on stage</td><td>Temporary to permanent</td><td>Tested in routine screening; reactive test triggers deferral and investigation</td></tr>
<tr><td>HIV</td><td>No</td><td>Permanent</td><td>Tested in every routine screening; permanently deferred if positive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hepatitis B</td><td>No</td><td>Permanent</td><td>Tested in every routine screening; permanently deferred if positive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hepatitis C</td><td>No</td><td>Permanent</td><td>Tested in every routine screening; permanently deferred if positive</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Key takeaway: herpes (both types), HPV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea result in temporary or conditional deferrals at most. The permanently disqualifying STIs are HIV and hepatitis &mdash; and those are actively tested for with every single donation. Herpes is not tested for and is not in the same category.

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have herpes?</h3>
<p>Yes, in most cases. Both HSV-1 (oral herpes / cold sores) and HSV-2 (genital herpes) are not automatic disqualifiers at any major plasma center. You can donate as long as you have no active outbreak, open sores, or lesions at the time of your appointment. Once the virus is dormant and any sores are fully healed, all major plasma centers will accept you as a donor with no restrictions.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with a cold sore?</h3>
<p>Not while the cold sore is active. You must wait until the sore is completely healed with no scabbing, crusting, or open skin remaining. Most centers require 7-14 days after full healing before you can donate. If you show up with a visible cold sore, staff will notice it during the physical check and issue a temporary deferral until it resolves.</p>

<h3>Do plasma centers test for herpes?</h3>
<p>No. Standard plasma screening blood work tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. Herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) is not part of routine donor screening. This is because herpes is not considered a meaningful risk for plasma product safety. Your eligibility is determined by your physical exam and health questionnaire responses, not by blood testing for HSV.</p>

<h3>Does Valtrex disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>No. Antiviral medications like valacyclovir (Valtrex), acyclovir (Zovirax), and famciclovir (Famvir) are accepted at all major plasma centers including CSL Plasma, BioLife, Octapharma, and Grifols. You can donate while taking these medications as long as you have no active outbreak. Continue taking your antivirals on your normal schedule &mdash; there is no need to skip a dose before or after donating.</p>

<h3>Do I have to tell the plasma center I have herpes?</h3>
<p>You should answer all screening questions honestly. However, most plasma center questionnaires do not specifically ask about herpes. They ask about current infections, open sores, and general health. If you have no active symptoms, herpes typically does not come up during screening at all. If you are asked directly about medical conditions, answer truthfully &mdash; having herpes will not disqualify you when the virus is dormant.</p>

<h3>How long after a herpes outbreak can I donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most centers require you to wait until all lesions are completely healed with no scabbing or crusting. This typically means 7-14 days after the last sore has fully closed and the skin has returned to normal. Some centers may ask you to wait a full 14 days after complete healing to be safe. If your outbreak was accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever or body aches, you may need to wait until those resolve as well.</p>

<h3>Can herpes be transmitted through donated plasma?</h3>
<p>The risk is extremely low &mdash; effectively zero. HSV is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, not through blood or plasma. During dormant periods, viral shedding in blood is negligible. Additionally, plasma undergoes multiple pathogen inactivation processing steps &mdash; including solvent/detergent treatment and nanofiltration &mdash; that eliminate enveloped viruses like HSV before the plasma reaches any patient.</p>

<h3>Will having herpes affect how much I get paid for plasma?</h3>
<p>No. Herpes status has absolutely no effect on your compensation. You receive the same pay as any other donor at your center. Your pay rate is determined by your body weight, donation frequency, new donor bonuses, and center-specific promotions &mdash; not by your HSV status or any other medical condition. Use our <a href="/">plasma pay calculator</a> to estimate your potential earnings.</p>
