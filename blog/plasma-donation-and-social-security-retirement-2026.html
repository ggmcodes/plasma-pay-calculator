    <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
    <p><strong>Plasma donation income does NOT reduce your Social Security retirement benefits.</strong> Your SS benefit amount is based on your lifetime earnings record, not current income. However, plasma compensation is taxable income, and earning extra money can push your "combined income" above IRS thresholds that trigger taxation of your Social Security benefits &mdash; meaning you could owe taxes on up to 85% of your SS payments.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="direct-impact">Does Plasma Income Directly Reduce Social Security?</h2>

<p>No. Social Security retirement benefits are calculated using your highest 35 years of earnings. Once you're receiving benefits, no amount of plasma donation income will reduce your monthly payment amount. Here's the critical distinction:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Benefit calculation:</strong> Based entirely on your lifetime earnings record (highest 35 years of wages subject to FICA taxes)</li>
    <li><strong>Plasma income:</strong> Classified as "other income" by the IRS, not W-2 wages &mdash; it doesn't factor into your benefit calculation</li>
    <li><strong>Earnings test (under full retirement age):</strong> Only applies to W-2 wages and net self-employment income, NOT plasma compensation</li>
    <li><strong>After full retirement age:</strong> No earnings test at all &mdash; earn as much as you want without benefit reduction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key point:</strong> If you're under full retirement age (66-67 depending on birth year) and still working a regular job, W-2 wages can trigger the earnings test. But plasma income alone will not.</p>

<h3>Why Plasma Pay Isn't "Earned Income" for SS Purposes</h3>

<p>Plasma compensation is treated as payment for your time, not employment wages. Centers don't issue W-2 forms or withhold FICA taxes. This means plasma income:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does NOT count toward the Social Security earnings test</li>
    <li>Does NOT earn additional Social Security credits</li>
    <li>Does NOT increase future benefit amounts</li>
    <li>Is NOT subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="taxation-thresholds">How Plasma Income Can Trigger SS Benefit Taxation</h2>

<p>While plasma income won't reduce your SS check, it CAN cause more of your Social Security benefits to become taxable. The IRS uses "combined income" (also called "provisional income") to determine how much of your SS is subject to federal income tax.</p>

<h3>2026 Social Security Taxation Thresholds</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Filing Status</th>

            <td>Up to 85% taxable</td>
            <td>$1,500&ndash;$5,000+ additional tax</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Note: These thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation since 1993. Many retirees exceed them even with modest additional income.</em></p>

<h2 id="combined-income">How to Calculate Your Combined Income</h2>

<p>The IRS formula for combined income is:</p>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; border-left: 4px solid #0ea5e9; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: 700; margin: 0;">Combined Income = Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + Nontaxable Interest + 50% of Social Security Benefits</p>
</div>

<p>Your plasma donation income gets added to your AGI. Here's an example:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Income Source</th>
            <th>Without Plasma</th>
            <th>With Plasma ($5,000/yr)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Social Security Benefits</td>
            <td>$24,000</td>
            <td>$24,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pension/401(k) Withdrawals</td>
            <td>$10,000</td>
            <td>$10,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Plasma Donation Income</td>
            <td>$0</td>
            <td>$5,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>50% of SS Benefits</td>
            <td>$12,000</td>
            <td>$12,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Combined Income</strong></td>
            <td><strong>$22,000</strong></td>
            <td><strong>$27,000</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>SS Benefits Taxable?</strong></td>
            <td><strong>0% (under $25K)</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Up to 50% (over $25K)</strong></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>In this example, adding $5,000 in plasma income pushed the retiree over the $25,000 threshold, making up to 50% of their $24,000 SS benefit potentially taxable &mdash; that's up to $12,000 in newly taxable income.</p>

<h2 id="medicare-irmaa">Medicare Part B Premiums & IRMAA</h2>

<p>Medicare Part B premiums are income-based. Higher earners pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) surcharge. However, plasma income alone is very unlikely to trigger IRMAA:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Filing Status</th>
            <th>Modified AGI Threshold</th>
            <th>Monthly Part B Premium (2026)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Single</td>
            <td>$103,000 or less</td>
            <td>Standard (~$185/mo)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Single</td>
            <td>$103,001 &ndash; $129,000</td>
            <td>~$259/mo (+$74)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
            <td>$206,000 or less</td>
            <td>Standard (~$185/mo)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
            <td>$206,001 &ndash; $258,000</td>
            <td>~$259/mo (+$74)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Unless you have significant other income (pensions, 401k, investments), plasma income of $4,000&ndash;$8,000/year will not push most retirees into IRMAA territory. The thresholds start at $103K for singles.</p>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for Retirees Donating Plasma</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Know your combined income threshold:</strong> Calculate whether adding plasma income will cross the $25K (single) or $32K (married) line</li>
    <li><strong>Track all plasma payments:</strong> Keep records of every payment received for accurate tax reporting</li>
    <li><strong>Consider timing:</strong> If you're close to a threshold, you might limit donations in December or increase them in January to manage annual income</li>
    <li><strong>Deduct eligible expenses:</strong> Mileage to/from the center may be deductible, reducing your taxable plasma income</li>
    <li><strong>Consult a tax professional:</strong> A CPA or enrolled agent experienced with retirement income can optimize your situation</li>
    <li><strong>Don't avoid income out of fear:</strong> Even if some SS becomes taxable, the plasma income itself still nets you money &mdash; you keep most of it</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will donating plasma reduce my Social Security check?</h3>
<p>No. Your Social Security retirement benefit amount is based on your lifetime earnings record (highest 35 years). Plasma donation income has zero effect on your monthly benefit amount. It is not considered "earned income" for the Social Security earnings test.</p>

<h3>Does plasma income count toward the Social Security earnings test?</h3>
<p>No. The Social Security earnings test only applies to W-2 wages and net self-employment income. Plasma compensation is classified as "other income" and does not trigger the earnings test, even if you're under full retirement age.</p>

<h3>Can plasma income make my Social Security benefits taxable?</h3>
<p>Yes. Plasma income increases your "combined income" for IRS purposes. If your combined income exceeds $25,000 (single) or $32,000 (married filing jointly), up to 50-85% of your Social Security benefits become subject to federal income tax.</p>

<h3>Will plasma donations affect my Medicare premiums?</h3>
<p>Very unlikely. Medicare Part B IRMAA surcharges only kick in at $103,000+ (single) or $206,000+ (married). Plasma income of $4,000-$8,000/year alone won't reach these thresholds unless you already have substantial other income.</p>

<h3>Should I report plasma income on my taxes if I'm retired?</h3>
<p>Yes. All plasma donation compensation is taxable income regardless of your retirement status. If you receive more than $600 from a single center, they should issue a 1099-MISC. Even below $600, you're required to report it as "other income" on your tax return.</p>
