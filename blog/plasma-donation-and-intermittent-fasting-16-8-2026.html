    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #065f46; font-size: 1.3rem;">Quick Answer</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>You can donate plasma while practicing intermittent fasting (16:8, 18:6, or OMAD), but you must eat before donating.</strong> Plasma centers strongly recommend eating a protein-rich meal 2-3 hours before your appointment. Donating in a fasted state increases the risk of dizziness, fainting, low protein levels, and deferral. The solution is simple: schedule your plasma donation within your eating window, ideally 2-3 hours after a substantial meal. If your fasting window overlaps with available appointment times, break your fast early on donation days -- one meal adjustment twice a week will not undermine your fasting goals, but donating on an empty stomach can get you deferred or cause a medical emergency.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="if-and-plasma">Intermittent Fasting and Plasma Donation: The Core Challenge</h2>

<p>Intermittent fasting (IF) has become one of the most popular dietary patterns in the United States, with millions of practitioners following 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, or OMAD (One Meal A Day) schedules. If you are one of them and want to donate plasma, here is the fundamental tension you need to understand:</p>

<h3>The Conflict</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Intermittent Fasting Says</th><th>Plasma Donation Requires</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Do not eat during fasting window</td><td>Eat a protein-rich meal 2-3 hours before donation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Restrict eating to a specific window</td><td>Available appointment times may fall outside your window</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Maintain consistent eating schedule</td><td>Twice-weekly donations may disrupt your routine</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fat adaptation and ketosis goals</td><td>Post-donation recovery benefits from carbs and protein</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why You Cannot Donate in a Fasted State</h3>
<p>Donating plasma while fasting is genuinely dangerous. Here is what happens in your body during a fasted donation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low blood sugar:</strong> Fasting depletes glycogen stores and lowers blood glucose. The plasmapheresis process removes plasma volume and temporarily reduces blood volume. The combination of low blood sugar and reduced blood volume significantly increases the risk of syncope (fainting)</li>
    <li><strong>Protein depletion:</strong> Your total protein levels drop during extended fasting periods. Plasma centers require a minimum total protein of 6.0 g/dL. Fasting donors are more likely to fall below this threshold and be deferred</li>
    <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Many IF practitioners restrict beverages to water, black coffee, and tea during the fasting window. While water is fine, the lack of food-based hydration (foods contribute 20-30% of daily water intake) means fasting donors are often more dehydrated than they realize</li>
    <li><strong>Slower recovery:</strong> Without available nutrients for your body to use in regenerating plasma proteins, recovery after donation takes longer. This can affect your energy for the rest of the day and even into the next day</li>
    <li><strong>Vasovagal response:</strong> The combination of an empty stomach, needle anxiety, and blood volume reduction makes fasted donors much more prone to vasovagal reactions (sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure causing dizziness or fainting)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Intermittent fasting is compatible with plasma donation, but you must eat before donating. This is non-negotiable for your safety and your eligibility.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling">Schedule Donations Within Your Eating Window</h2>

<p>The simplest solution for IF practitioners is to schedule plasma donations during your eating window, ideally 2-3 hours after a substantial meal. Here is how to make this work with common IF schedules:</p>

<h3>16:8 Fasting (Most Popular)</h3>
<p>With a 16:8 schedule, you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window. This is the easiest IF pattern to combine with plasma donation.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Eating Window</th><th>Best Donation Time</th><th>Strategy</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>12 PM - 8 PM</td><td>2:00 PM - 5:00 PM</td><td>Eat your first meal at noon. Donate at 2-3 PM after your meal has digested. Plenty of time to eat again after donation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10 AM - 6 PM</td><td>12:00 PM - 3:00 PM</td><td>Eat your first meal at 10 AM. Donate at noon or early afternoon. Eat a recovery meal by 6 PM</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8 AM - 4 PM</td><td>10:00 AM - 1:00 PM</td><td>Eat breakfast at 8 AM. Donate mid-morning. This aligns with standard center hours perfectly</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2 PM - 10 PM</td><td>4:00 PM - 7:00 PM</td><td>Eat your first meal at 2 PM. Donate in the late afternoon. Later window may mean shorter center wait times</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>18:6 Fasting</h3>
<p>With a tighter 6-hour eating window, scheduling requires more precision but is still very doable:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eating window 12-6 PM:</strong> Eat at noon, donate at 2-3 PM. You have a 3-4 hour buffer to eat a recovery meal before your window closes</li>
    <li><strong>Eating window 1-7 PM:</strong> Eat at 1 PM, donate at 3-4 PM. Recovery meal by 7 PM</li>
    <li><strong>Key rule:</strong> Eat your first meal at least 2 hours before your appointment. Do not rush to the center immediately after eating -- give your body time to absorb nutrients</li>
</ul>

<h3>20:4 Fasting</h3>
<p>A 4-hour eating window is tight but manageable:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eating window 12-4 PM:</strong> Eat a substantial meal at noon. Donate at 2 PM. Quick recovery snack before 4 PM window close</li>
    <li><strong>On donation days, consider extending to 16:8:</strong> Widening your eating window on the 2 days per week you donate gives you more flexibility without significantly impacting your fasting goals over the week</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fasting-overlap">When Your Fasting Window Overlaps: Break Your Fast</h2>

<p>Sometimes your fasting window and available donation appointments overlap. Maybe the center only has morning slots and you do not eat until noon. Maybe you work afternoons and can only donate at 8 AM while following a 12-8 PM eating window. Here is the solution:</p>

<h3>Break Your Fast 2-3 Hours Before Donation</h3>
<p><strong>This is the correct answer every time.</strong> If your fasting window overlaps with your donation time, break your fast early on donation days. Here is why this is the right choice:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Safety first:</strong> Donating plasma in a fasted state risks fainting, dizziness, and medical emergencies. No fasting schedule is worth a medical incident at the plasma center</li>
    <li><strong>Deferral prevention:</strong> If your total protein is below 6.0 g/dL because you are fasting, you will be deferred. You wasted the trip, and you still do not get paid. Breaking your fast and eating a protein-rich meal prevents this entirely</li>
    <li><strong>Two days per week:</strong> You donate at most twice per week. Adjusting your fasting window for 2 out of 7 days is a minor modification that has negligible impact on your fasting benefits. You are still fasting 5 days per week on your normal schedule</li>
    <li><strong>Fasting benefits are not all-or-nothing:</strong> Research shows that the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting (improved insulin sensitivity, autophagy, fat oxidation) come from consistent long-term practice, not from never missing a single fasting window. Two modified days per week will not undo your progress</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Break Your Fast for Donation</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>2-3 hours before your appointment:</strong> Eat a substantial meal with 30-40g of protein, complex carbs, and moderate healthy fats</li>
    <li><strong>1 hour before:</strong> Drink 16 oz of water. You should already be well-hydrated from your fasting window (water, tea, and black coffee are fasting-safe)</li>
    <li><strong>At the center:</strong> Donate as normal. Your body has fuel, your protein levels are up, and your blood sugar is stable</li>
    <li><strong>After donation:</strong> Eat a recovery meal. If you want to resume fasting, start your fasting window after this recovery meal instead of after your morning meal</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adjusting Your Fasting Schedule on Donation Days</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Normal Schedule</th><th>Donation Day Adjustment</th><th>Impact on Weekly Fasting</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>16:8 (12 PM - 8 PM eating)</td><td>Eat at 9 AM, donate at 11 AM, resume 16:8 next day</td><td>2 shorter fasts per week (13-14 hrs instead of 16)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>18:6 (1 PM - 7 PM eating)</td><td>Eat at 10 AM, donate at 12 PM, resume 18:6 next day</td><td>2 shorter fasts per week (15 hrs instead of 18)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>20:4 (2 PM - 6 PM eating)</td><td>Eat at 10 AM, donate at 12 PM, 4 PM window still works</td><td>2 shorter fasts per week (16 hrs instead of 20)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>OMAD (one meal 5-6 PM)</td><td>Eat a pre-donation meal + your OMAD meal on donation days</td><td>2 two-meal days per week instead of OMAD</td></tr>
    </tbody>

<h2 id="protein-tips">Protein and Hematocrit Tips for IF Practitioners</h2>

<p>Intermittent fasting can affect two key screening metrics at plasma centers: total protein and hematocrit. Here is how to keep both in the acceptable range while maintaining your fasting lifestyle:</p>

<h3>Total Protein Concerns</h3>
<p>The minimum total protein for plasma donation is 6.0 g/dL. IF practitioners are at higher risk of falling below this threshold because:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Compressed eating window:</strong> You have less time to consume protein throughout the day. Someone eating 3 meals over 12 hours naturally spreads protein intake. Someone eating in a 4-8 hour window must be more intentional</li>
    <li><strong>Fasting state protein:</strong> During your fasting window, your body breaks down some proteins for gluconeogenesis (making glucose from non-carb sources). This can temporarily lower circulating protein levels</li>
    <li><strong>OMAD risk:</strong> OMAD practitioners who eat only one meal may not consume enough total protein in that single meal to maintain optimal blood protein levels for donation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protein Strategy for IF Donors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Aim for 0.7-1.0g protein per pound of body weight daily:</strong> A 150 lb IF practitioner should target 105-150g of protein per day. This is achievable in any eating window but requires planning</li>
    <li><strong>Front-load protein on donation days:</strong> Make your pre-donation meal protein-heavy (40-50g). This ensures peak blood protein levels at the time of screening</li>
    <li><strong>Protein shake strategy:</strong> A 30g protein shake is an easy way to add protein quickly at the start of your eating window, especially on donation days</li>
    <li><strong>Post-donation protein:</strong> Eat 30-40g of protein within 2 hours after donation to support plasma protein regeneration. Your body rebuilds donated plasma proteins within 24-48 hours, but needs dietary protein as raw material</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hematocrit Concerns</h3>
<p>Hematocrit (the percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells) must be at least 38% for women and 39% for men. IF can affect this in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dehydration during fasting:</strong> If you do not drink enough water during your fasting window, dehydration concentrates your blood and can falsely elevate hematocrit. This is not dangerous per se, but hydration-related hematocrit swings can make your readings inconsistent</li>
    <li><strong>Iron intake:</strong> IF practitioners eating fewer meals may consume less iron, which can lower hematocrit over time. Focus on iron-rich foods (red meat, spinach, beans, fortified cereals) during your eating window</li>
    <li><strong>Hydration protocol:</strong> Drink at least 64 oz of water during your fasting window (water does not break your fast). This maintains proper hydration and stable hematocrit levels</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="omad-challenges">OMAD-Specific Challenges</h2>

<p>One Meal A Day (OMAD) practitioners face the greatest challenges combining fasting with plasma donation. If you eat only one meal per day, here is how to make donation work:</p>

<h3>The OMAD Dilemma</h3>
<p>OMAD typically means eating one large meal in the evening (5-7 PM for most practitioners). Plasma centers are typically open 6 AM - 7 PM. If you eat at 6 PM and the center opens at 6 AM, you have been fasting for 12+ hours before any morning appointment -- too long for safe donation.</p>

<h3>OMAD Solutions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Option 1: Two meals on donation days.</strong> This is the most practical solution. Eat a pre-donation meal 2-3 hours before your appointment, donate, and eat your regular OMAD meal in the evening. You are eating two meals instead of one on 2 days per week -- this is not going to derail your OMAD benefits</li>
    <li><strong>Option 2: Shift your OMAD meal to pre-donation.</strong> Instead of eating at 6 PM, eat your one meal at 11 AM on donation days and donate at 1-2 PM. You still eat only one meal, but it is timed around your appointment</li>
    <li><strong>Option 3: Late afternoon appointments.</strong> If your OMAD meal is at noon, schedule donation for 2-3 PM. If your meal is at 2 PM, schedule donation for 4-5 PM. Match your single meal to your appointment time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nutritional Requirements for OMAD Donors</h3>
<p>Since you are packing all your nutrition into one meal (or two on donation days), that meal must be nutritionally dense:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 40-60g minimum in your pre-donation meal (chicken breast, salmon, eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake)</li>
    <li><strong>Complex carbs:</strong> Sweet potatoes, brown rice, oats, whole grain bread -- these provide sustained energy during donation</li>
    <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Red meat, spinach, beans, or iron-fortified foods to maintain hematocrit</li>
    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> 80+ oz of water throughout the day (water does not break your fast)</li>
    <li><strong>Sodium:</strong> Include some salt in your meal -- sodium helps retain fluids and supports blood volume during donation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-donation-meals">Best Pre-Donation Meals for IF Donors</h2>

<p>Your pre-donation meal needs to serve two purposes: break your fast properly AND prepare your body for plasma donation. Here are meals designed specifically for IF practitioners heading to the plasma center:</p>

<h3>High-Protein, Fast-Breaking Meals</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Greek yogurt power bowl:</strong> 1 cup Greek yogurt (20g protein) + protein granola (10g protein) + berries + honey. Quick, easy, gentle on an empty stomach. Total: 30g protein</li>
    <li><strong>Egg and avocado plate:</strong> 3 scrambled eggs (18g protein) + 1/2 avocado + whole grain toast. Heart-healthy fats and protein in an easy meal. Total: 25g protein</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken and rice bowl:</strong> 6 oz grilled chicken (42g protein) + brown rice + steamed vegetables. Classic high-protein meal that digests well. Total: 45g protein</li>
    <li><strong>Protein shake + banana:</strong> 1 scoop whey protein (25-30g) + milk + banana. The fastest option when time is short. Total: 30-35g protein</li>
    <li><strong>Turkey and cheese wrap:</strong> 4 oz turkey (24g protein) + cheese + lettuce + whole wheat wrap. Easy to prepare and eat on the go. Total: 32g protein</li>
    <li><strong>Salmon with sweet potato:</strong> 5 oz baked salmon (35g protein) + sweet potato + green beans. Omega-3s support recovery. Total: 38g protein</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Avoid as a Fast-Breaking Pre-Donation Meal</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Very high-fat meals:</strong> Breaking your fast with pizza, burgers, or fried food can cause lipemic (milky) plasma that gets rejected. Choose lean proteins</li>
    <li><strong>Pure sugar/simple carbs:</strong> Breaking a fast with candy, soda, or white bread causes a blood sugar spike followed by a crash -- exactly what you do not want during a 45-90 minute donation</li>
    <li><strong>Very large meals:</strong> Eating too much too fast after a long fast can cause nausea and stomach discomfort. Eat a moderate portion, not a feast, before donating</li>
    <li><strong>Heavy dairy:</strong> Full-fat ice cream, heavy cream, or large amounts of whole milk can contribute to lipemic plasma</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive caffeine:</strong> If you drink black coffee during your fast, avoid adding more caffeine with your pre-donation meal. Too much caffeine can elevate heart rate and blood pressure at screening</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma while intermittent fasting?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you must eat before donating. Schedule your plasma donation within your eating window, ideally 2-3 hours after a protein-rich meal. If your fasting window overlaps with your appointment time, break your fast early on donation days. Donating in a fasted state increases the risk of fainting, low protein deferral, and slower recovery.</p>

<h3>Should I break my fast to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Yes, absolutely. If your fasting window overlaps with your donation appointment, break your fast 2-3 hours before donating. You donate at most twice per week -- adjusting your fast for 2 out of 7 days has negligible impact on your fasting benefits. Donating on an empty stomach risks fainting, deferral for low protein, and medical complications.</p>

<h3>Can I do OMAD and donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you will need to either eat two meals on donation days (a pre-donation meal plus your regular OMAD meal) or shift your one meal to 2-3 hours before your appointment. The most practical approach for OMAD donors is eating a pre-donation meal and your evening meal on the 2 donation days per week.</p>

<h3>Will intermittent fasting cause low protein at plasma screening?</h3>
<p>It can. IF practitioners are at higher risk of falling below the 6.0 g/dL total protein minimum because of compressed eating windows and protein used for gluconeogenesis during fasting. To prevent this, aim for 0.7-1.0g protein per pound of body weight daily and front-load protein on donation days with a 40-50g protein pre-donation meal.</p>

<h3>What is the best eating window for plasma donation?</h3>
<p>For 16:8 fasting with a 12 PM - 8 PM eating window (the most common schedule), the ideal donation time is 2-5 PM -- after your first meal has digested. For earlier eating windows (8 AM - 4 PM or 10 AM - 6 PM), late morning or early afternoon appointments work best. Schedule your donation 2-3 hours after your first meal of the day.</p>
