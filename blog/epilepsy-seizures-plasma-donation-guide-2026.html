<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><div class="big-number">USUALLY NO</div><p><strong>Most plasma centers defer donors with active epilepsy or any seizure disorder requiring medication.</strong> However, if you have been completely seizure-free for 3+ years AND are no longer taking any anti-seizure medication, some centers may consider you eligible. Childhood febrile seizures and single provoked seizures that never recurred are typically not disqualifying. Policies vary significantly between centers, so always call ahead before visiting.</p></div>

<h2 id="why-epilepsy-matters">Why Epilepsy Affects Plasma Donation Eligibility</h2>

<p>Epilepsy and seizure disorders create unique concerns for plasma donation that go beyond most other medical conditions. Understanding why these restrictions exist can help you determine whether you might qualify and how to approach the screening process.</p>

<h3>Seizure Risk During the Donation Process</h3>
<p>The plasma donation process involves being connected to an apheresis machine through a needle in your arm for 45 to 90 minutes. During this time, your blood is drawn, separated, and the red blood cells are returned to your body. Several aspects of this process can potentially trigger seizures in susceptible individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood volume changes:</strong> The temporary reduction in blood volume during plasmapheresis can lower blood pressure, which may trigger seizures in people with epilepsy</li>
<li><strong>Electrolyte shifts:</strong> The citrate anticoagulant used during donation can temporarily alter calcium and other electrolyte levels, and electrolyte imbalances are known seizure triggers</li>
<li><strong>Physical stress:</strong> The donation process places mild physical stress on the body, and stress is a recognized seizure trigger for many people with epilepsy</li>
<li><strong>Dehydration risk:</strong> Even with proper preparation, the fluid loss during donation can contribute to dehydration, another common seizure trigger</li>
<li><strong>Fatigue and low blood sugar:</strong> Fasting requirements before donation and the physical toll of the process can cause fatigue and hypoglycemia, both of which lower seizure thresholds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safety Concerns for the Donor</h3>
<p>A seizure during donation creates serious safety risks. The donor is connected to a machine with a large-bore needle in their arm. A tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure could result in the needle being dislodged, causing significant bleeding or vein damage. The donor could also fall from the donation chair and sustain injuries. Center staff, while trained in basic first aid, are not equipped to manage complex seizure emergencies the way hospital staff would be.</p>

<h3>Medication Concerns for Plasma Recipients</h3>
<p>Plasma collected from donors is processed into therapies for patients with serious conditions, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, and burn injuries. Anti-seizure medications present in donated plasma could potentially affect vulnerable recipients. The FDA and plasma collection companies maintain strict standards about which medications are acceptable in donated plasma, and most anti-epileptic drugs do not meet these standards.</p>

<h2 id="active-vs-controlled">Active Epilepsy vs Controlled Epilepsy: Key Differences</h2>

<p>Not all seizure disorders are treated the same way when it comes to plasma donation eligibility. Centers draw important distinctions between active and controlled epilepsy, though even "controlled" epilepsy on medication is typically disqualifying.</p>

<h3>Active Epilepsy (Always Disqualifying)</h3>
<p>If you currently experience seizures of any type, you will be deferred from plasma donation at every center. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures:</strong> Full-body convulsive seizures</li>
<li><strong>Absence seizures:</strong> Brief episodes of staring or unresponsiveness</li>
<li><strong>Focal seizures:</strong> Seizures affecting one area of the brain, with or without loss of awareness</li>
<li><strong>Myoclonic seizures:</strong> Sudden, brief jerking of muscles</li>
<li><strong>Atonic seizures:</strong> Sudden loss of muscle tone causing falls</li>
</ul>
<p>Any seizure within the past 3 years (or 5 years at some centers), regardless of type or severity, will result in deferral.</p>

<h3>Controlled Epilepsy on Medication (Usually Disqualifying)</h3>
<p>Even if your epilepsy is perfectly controlled and you have not had a seizure in years, being on anti-seizure medication is typically a disqualifying factor on its own. The reasoning is twofold: the medication indicates ongoing seizure risk, and the medication itself cannot be present in donated plasma.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Key Distinction</h3>
<p><strong>"Controlled" is not the same as "resolved."</strong> If you need medication to prevent seizures, your epilepsy is controlled but still active from a donation eligibility standpoint. To qualify, most centers require that your epilepsy be fully resolved, meaning no seizures AND no medication for an extended period.</p>
</div>

<h3>Resolved Epilepsy (May Qualify)</h3>
<p>Some individuals outgrow epilepsy, particularly certain childhood-onset forms. If you meet ALL of the following criteria, you may be eligible at some centers:</p>
<ul>
<li>No seizures of any type for at least 3 years (5 years at some centers)</li>
<li>Completely off all anti-seizure medications for the entire seizure-free period</li>
<li>No underlying structural brain abnormality that caused the epilepsy</li>
<li>Cleared by a neurologist confirming the epilepsy has resolved</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="seizure-free">Seizure-Free Periods and Eligibility Requirements</h2>

<p>The length of time you need to be seizure-free is one of the most important factors in determining eligibility. Here is how different seizure-free periods are typically viewed:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Seizure-Free Period</th><th>On Medication?</th><th>Likely Eligibility</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Less than 1 year</td><td>Yes</td><td>Deferred at all centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Less than 1 year</td><td>No</td><td>Deferred at all centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>1-2 years</td><td>Yes</td><td>Deferred at all centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>1-2 years</td><td>No</td><td>Deferred at most centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4 years</td><td>Yes</td><td>Deferred (medication disqualifies)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4 years</td><td>No</td><td>May qualify at some centers</td></tr>
<tr><td>5+ years</td><td>Yes</td><td>Deferred (medication disqualifies)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5+ years</td><td>No</td><td>Eligible at most centers</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Why the 3-Year Minimum Matters</h3>
<p>The 3-year seizure-free threshold is not arbitrary. Medical research shows that the risk of seizure recurrence drops significantly after a person has been seizure-free and off medication for 3 or more years. After 5 years without seizures or medication, the recurrence risk approaches that of the general population for many types of epilepsy. This is why most centers use 3 years as the minimum and some use 5 years as an added safety margin.</p>

<h3>Important: The Clock Starts When You Stop Medication</h3>
<p>A critical point many people miss: the seizure-free period typically must be <strong>medication-free</strong> as well. If you stopped having seizures 5 years ago but only stopped your medication 1 year ago, most centers will count your seizure-free period as starting from when you stopped the medication, not when the seizures stopped. This means you would need to wait an additional 2 to 4 years before qualifying.</p>

<h2 id="medications">Anti-Seizure Medications and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>If you are currently taking any anti-seizure medication, you will almost certainly be deferred from plasma donation. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common anti-epileptic drugs and their impact on donation eligibility.</p>

<h3>Medications That Disqualify You From Donating Plasma</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Medication (Brand Name)</th><th>Generic Name</th><th>Can You Donate?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Dilantin</strong></td><td>Phenytoin</td><td>NO</td><td>One of the oldest AEDs; affects plasma protein binding significantly</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tegretol</strong></td><td>Carbamazepine</td><td>NO</td><td>Induces liver enzymes; changes plasma composition</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Depakote</strong></td><td>Valproic Acid</td><td>NO</td><td>Known teratogen; cannot be in plasma products given to pregnant patients</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Lamictal</strong></td><td>Lamotrigine</td><td>NO</td><td>Commonly prescribed; still disqualifying despite relatively mild side effect profile</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Keppra</strong></td><td>Levetiracetam</td><td>NO</td><td>One of the most prescribed AEDs; disqualifying at all major centers</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Topamax</strong></td><td>Topiramate</td><td>NO</td><td>Also used for migraines, but disqualifying regardless of indication</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Trileptal</strong></td><td>Oxcarbazepine</td><td>NO</td><td>Related to carbamazepine; same deferral status</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Neurontin</strong></td><td>Gabapentin</td><td>DEPENDS</td><td>If prescribed for seizures: NO. If for nerve pain only and no seizure history: may be acceptable at some centers</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Zonegran</strong></td><td>Zonisamide</td><td>NO</td><td>Permanent deferral while taking</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Vimpat</strong></td><td>Lacosamide</td><td>NO</td><td>Newer AED; still disqualifying</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Fycompa</strong></td><td>Perampanel</td><td>NO</td><td>Permanent deferral while taking</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Briviact</strong></td><td>Brivaracetam</td><td>NO</td><td>Related to levetiracetam; same deferral</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Why These Medications Disqualify Donors</h3>
<p>Anti-seizure medications disqualify donors for several overlapping reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recipient safety:</strong> These drugs pass into plasma and could affect patients who receive plasma-derived therapies, particularly pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals</li>
<li><strong>Teratogenic risk:</strong> Several AEDs (especially valproic acid and phenytoin) are known to cause birth defects. Plasma products are sometimes given to pregnant patients, so these drugs absolutely cannot be present</li>
<li><strong>Active condition indicator:</strong> Taking an AED means you have an active seizure risk, even if currently controlled. This creates liability concerns for the center</li>
<li><strong>Plasma composition changes:</strong> Some AEDs (particularly enzyme-inducing drugs like carbamazepine and phenytoin) alter liver function and change the protein composition of plasma, potentially reducing its therapeutic value</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Case: Gabapentin and Pregabalin</h3>
<p>Gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) are unique because they are prescribed both as anti-seizure medications and for non-seizure conditions like nerve pain, fibromyalgia, and anxiety. Your eligibility may depend on <strong>why</strong> you take the medication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prescribed for seizures:</strong> Disqualifying at all centers</li>
<li><strong>Prescribed for nerve pain with no seizure history:</strong> May be acceptable at some centers. You will need to provide documentation of the prescribing reason</li>
<li><strong>Prescribed for both:</strong> Disqualifying</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="febrile-seizures">Febrile Seizures in Childhood</h2>

<p>Febrile seizures are a common concern for people considering plasma donation. These seizures occur in young children (usually ages 6 months to 5 years) in response to high fever and are generally considered a separate condition from epilepsy.</p>

<h3>Good News: Usually Not Disqualifying</h3>
<p>If your only seizure history consists of febrile seizures during early childhood, you will likely qualify for plasma donation as an adult. Here is what most centers look for:</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Febrile Seizure Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age of occurrence:</strong> Seizures happened only before age 5-6</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Seizures were clearly associated with high fever (typically above 101 degrees F)</li>
<li><strong>No recurrence:</strong> No seizures of any type after the febrile seizure period ended</li>
<li><strong>No treatment:</strong> No ongoing anti-seizure medication was required</li>
<li><strong>No epilepsy diagnosis:</strong> Never diagnosed with epilepsy or a seizure disorder</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>When Febrile Seizures Might Still Disqualify</h3>
<p>Some situations involving febrile seizures may still cause issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex febrile seizures:</strong> Seizures lasting more than 15 minutes, occurring more than once in 24 hours, or affecting only one side of the body may raise additional concerns</li>
<li><strong>Febrile seizures that led to an epilepsy diagnosis:</strong> About 2-5% of children with febrile seizures go on to develop epilepsy. If this happened to you, the epilepsy rules apply, not the febrile seizure rules</li>
<li><strong>Febrile seizures beyond age 6:</strong> Fever-triggered seizures occurring after early childhood are more concerning and may be evaluated differently</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-time-seizure">One-Time Seizure vs Diagnosed Epilepsy</h2>

<p>There is an important distinction between having a single seizure and being diagnosed with epilepsy. Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart, or one unprovoked seizure with a high risk of recurrence. A single seizure does not automatically mean you have epilepsy.</p>

<h3>Provoked (Acute Symptomatic) Seizures</h3>
<p>A provoked seizure has an identifiable external cause. These are generally viewed more favorably than unprovoked seizures for donation eligibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head injury/concussion:</strong> Seizure occurring at the time of or shortly after a head injury</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol withdrawal:</strong> Seizure during acute alcohol withdrawal</li>
<li><strong>Drug reaction:</strong> Seizure caused by a medication side effect or drug interaction</li>
<li><strong>Severe electrolyte imbalance:</strong> Seizure due to dangerously low sodium, glucose, or calcium</li>
<li><strong>High fever in adults:</strong> Rare, but can occur with extremely high fevers</li>
<li><strong>Eclampsia:</strong> Seizures during pregnancy due to preeclampsia</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had a single provoked seizure, the cause was identified and resolved, no anti-seizure medication was needed long-term, and you have been seizure-free for 3+ years, many centers will consider you eligible.</p>

<h3>Unprovoked Seizures</h3>
<p>An unprovoked seizure has no identifiable external trigger. Even a single unprovoked seizure is treated more cautiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centers will want to know if brain imaging (MRI/CT) showed any structural abnormality</li>
<li>An EEG showing epileptiform activity may be disqualifying even without further seizures</li>
<li>If you were placed on anti-seizure medication after a single unprovoked seizure, the medication rules apply</li>
<li>Most centers require the same 3-5 year seizure-free, medication-free period</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vns">Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>A vagus nerve stimulator is a device surgically implanted under the skin of the chest that sends electrical impulses to the brain through the vagus nerve to help prevent seizures. It is used for epilepsy that does not respond well to medication alone.</p>

<h3>VNS Always Disqualifies</h3>
<p>Having a vagus nerve stimulator implanted is a permanent disqualification from plasma donation at virtually all centers. The reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active treatment indicator:</strong> A VNS means your epilepsy is severe enough to require surgical intervention, indicating significant ongoing seizure risk</li>
<li><strong>Device interference concerns:</strong> While plasma donation equipment is unlikely to interfere with a modern VNS, centers are not willing to accept even theoretical risk to an implanted medical device</li>
<li><strong>Liability:</strong> If any adverse event occurred during donation, the presence of the VNS creates complex medical-legal issues for the center</li>
<li><strong>Even if turned off:</strong> Having the device implanted is disqualifying regardless of whether it is currently activated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Implanted Devices</h3>
<p>Similarly, other devices used for seizure management also disqualify donors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive neurostimulation (RNS):</strong> Disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for epilepsy:</strong> Disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Previous epilepsy surgery (lobectomy, etc.):</strong> Typically disqualifying, though policies vary</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-by-Center Policies for Epilepsy</h2>

<p>Plasma center policies on epilepsy vary more than you might expect. While the general trend is to defer donors with any seizure history, the specific criteria for exceptions differ between companies.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>Active Epilepsy</th><th>Seizure-Free (No Meds)</th><th>Febrile Seizures Only</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>CSL Plasma</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>May accept after 3+ years</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>BioLife Plasma</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>May accept after 3-5 years</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Octapharma</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>Case-by-case review</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>BPL Plasma</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>May accept after 5+ years</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>GCAM/Grifols</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>May accept after 3+ years</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>KEDPLASMA</strong></td><td>Deferred</td><td>Case-by-case review</td><td>Usually eligible</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class="info-box"><div class="info-box-title">Important</div><p>These policies are based on general guidelines and donor reports. Individual centers within the same chain may interpret policies differently. Medical directors at each location have some discretion. <strong>Always call your specific center before visiting.</strong></p></div>

<h3>What to Ask When You Call</h3>
<p>When contacting a center about epilepsy eligibility, ask these specific questions:</p>

<h2 id="seizure-at-center">What Happens If You Have a Seizure at a Center</h2>

<p>Understanding what would happen in the event of a seizure during donation helps explain why centers take eligibility so seriously.</p>

<h3>Immediate Response</h3>
<p>If a donor experiences a seizure during the donation process, center staff follow emergency protocols:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Machine stopped immediately:</strong> The apheresis machine is halted and the needle is removed as safely as possible</li>
<li><strong>Seizure first aid:</strong> The donor is positioned on their side (recovery position), the area is cleared of hazards, and nothing is placed in the mouth</li>
<li><strong>Emergency services called:</strong> 911 is called for any tonic-clonic seizure or any seizure lasting more than 5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Staff monitor breathing, pulse, and consciousness throughout the event and recovery period</li>
<li><strong>Medical evaluation:</strong> The donor is not released until cleared, usually by EMS or after a sufficient observation period for brief seizures</li>
</ol>

<h3>Consequences After a Seizure at a Center</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permanent deferral:</strong> You will be permanently deferred from that center and typically from all centers in the same company network</li>
<li><strong>Plasma discarded:</strong> Any plasma collected during that session will be discarded</li>
<li><strong>Medical record update:</strong> The event is documented in your donor file and may be shared with national donor deferral databases</li>
<li><strong>Other centers affected:</strong> If the information enters a shared database, other plasma companies may also defer you</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nondisclosure Risks</h3>
<p>Some people with seizure disorders consider not disclosing their condition during screening. This is strongly discouraged for several critical reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your safety:</strong> A seizure during donation could result in serious injury, including harm from the needle, falling, or injury during convulsions</li>
<li><strong>Legal consequences:</strong> Providing false information on the health questionnaire is a form of fraud. You sign legal documents attesting to the accuracy of your answers</li>
<li><strong>Recipient harm:</strong> If your plasma contains anti-seizure medications and is given to a vulnerable patient, you could be held liable</li>
<li><strong>Permanent ban:</strong> If discovered, nondisclosure results in permanent deferral and potential legal action</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="medical-clearance">Medical Clearance Requirements</h2>

<p>If a center is willing to consider you despite a seizure history, you will likely need to provide medical documentation. Here is what to prepare.</p>

<h3>Documentation You May Need</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neurologist letter:</strong> A letter from your neurologist confirming your diagnosis, treatment history, and current status. This should specifically state how long you have been seizure-free and whether you are off all anti-seizure medications</li>
<li><strong>Medication history:</strong> A complete list of all anti-seizure medications you have taken, with dates started and stopped</li>
<li><strong>Seizure log:</strong> Documentation of your last seizure date and type</li>
<li><strong>EEG results:</strong> Some centers may want to see recent EEG results showing no epileptiform activity</li>
<li><strong>Brain imaging:</strong> MRI or CT results if available, particularly if your epilepsy was related to a structural cause</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Screening Process</h3>
<p>Even with documentation, expect a thorough screening:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial questionnaire:</strong> You will answer questions about seizure history on the standard health screening form</li>
<li><strong>Physical exam:</strong> The center physician or nurse practitioner will review your history in detail</li>
<li><strong>Medical director review:</strong> Your case will likely be escalated to the center's medical director for a decision</li>
<li><strong>Corporate review:</strong> Some centers must submit cases to corporate medical staff for approval</li>
<li><strong>Waiting period:</strong> This process can take days to weeks. Do not expect same-day approval</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternative Ways to Contribute If You Cannot Donate</h2>

<p>If epilepsy or seizure medication disqualifies you from plasma donation, there are still meaningful ways to contribute to healthcare and earn extra income.</p>

<h3>Healthcare Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epilepsy clinical trials:</strong> Many research studies actively recruit people with epilepsy. Compensation ranges from $50 to $500+ per visit depending on the study. Check <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> for opportunities near you</li>
<li><strong>Epilepsy advocacy:</strong> Organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation always need volunteers for awareness campaigns, fundraising, and support groups</li>
<li><strong>Blood donation (if eligible):</strong> Blood donation rules for epilepsy differ from plasma rules. The American Red Cross may accept donors with well-controlled epilepsy on certain medications. Check with your local blood bank</li>
<li><strong>Organ donor registration:</strong> Epilepsy does not disqualify you from being a registered organ donor</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternative Income Opportunities</h3>
<p>If you were considering plasma donation primarily for the income, consider these alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paid medical research:</strong> Beyond epilepsy-specific trials, many general research studies are available</li>
<li><strong>Online surveys and focus groups:</strong> Sites like Prolific and UserTesting pay for participation</li>
<li><strong>Freelance work:</strong> Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr offer flexible earning opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Rideshare or delivery:</strong> Apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Instacart offer flexible scheduling (check driving eligibility with your state's seizure-free driving requirements first)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps if You Have Epilepsy and Want to Donate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review your seizure history:</strong> Determine your exact seizure-free period and medication status before contacting any center</li>
<li><strong>Talk to your neurologist:</strong> Ask whether they consider your epilepsy resolved and whether they would provide documentation supporting donation eligibility</li>
<li><strong>Call centers directly:</strong> Do not just show up. Call 2-3 centers in your area to compare policies before visiting</li>
<li><strong>Bring documentation:</strong> If a center is willing to consider you, arrive with your neurologist letter and medication history ready</li>
<li><strong>Be completely honest:</strong> Full disclosure protects both you and future plasma recipients</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have epilepsy?</h3>
<p>Most plasma centers defer donors with active epilepsy or any seizure disorder requiring medication. If you have been seizure-free for 3 or more years and are completely off anti-seizure medication, some centers may consider you eligible. Policies vary, so always call ahead.</p>

<h3>How long do you have to be seizure-free to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most centers require a minimum of 3 years seizure-free with no anti-seizure medication. Some centers require 5 years. The seizure-free period typically must be completely medication-free, not just symptom-free while on medication.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma while taking anti-seizure medication?</h3>
<p>No. Almost all plasma centers permanently defer donors currently taking any anti-seizure medication, including phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote), lamotrigine (Lamictal), and levetiracetam (Keppra). These medications can affect plasma quality and recipient safety.</p>

<h3>Do childhood febrile seizures disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Usually no. Febrile seizures that occurred only in early childhood (typically before age 5) and never recurred are generally not considered a disqualifying seizure disorder. You should still disclose this history during screening.</p>

<h3>What happens if you have a seizure while donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Staff will immediately stop the donation, remove the needle safely, place you on your side, protect you from injury, and call emergency services if needed. You will be permanently deferred from future donations at that center and likely across all centers in that network.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS)?</h3>
<p>No. Having a vagus nerve stimulator implanted is a disqualifying condition at virtually all plasma centers. The device indicates active epilepsy treatment, and the electromagnetic equipment at some centers could theoretically interfere with the device.</p>

<h3>I had one seizure years ago but was never diagnosed with epilepsy. Can I donate?</h3>
<p>Possibly. A single provoked seizure (caused by a specific trigger like fever, head injury, alcohol withdrawal, or medication reaction) that never recurred and required no ongoing treatment may not disqualify you. You typically need to be at least 3 years past the event with no recurrence and no medication.</p>

<h3>Does epilepsy eligibility vary between plasma centers?</h3>
<p>Yes, significantly. CSL Plasma, BioLife, Octapharma, and other chains each have their own medical guidelines. Some may accept seizure-free donors after 3 years off medication, while others require 5 years or impose a permanent deferral regardless. Always call the specific center before visiting.</p>
