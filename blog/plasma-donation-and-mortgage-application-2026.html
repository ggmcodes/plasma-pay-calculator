    <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
    <p><strong>Plasma donation income generally does NOT count toward mortgage qualification.</strong> Mortgage lenders want to see stable, verifiable income from W-2 employment, self-employment with 2+ years of tax returns, or other documented sources like Social Security or pensions. However, if you have reported plasma income on your tax returns for 2 or more consecutive years, some lenders MAY consider it as supplemental income. The key is documentation: consistent reporting, 1099 forms, and tax return evidence are essential.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-lenders-want">What Mortgage Lenders Want to See</h2>

<p>To understand why plasma income is difficult to use for mortgage qualification, you need to understand what lenders actually look for when evaluating your income:</p>

<h3>The Three Cs of Mortgage Lending</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Can you afford the monthly payment? (Income-to-debt ratio)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Do you pay your bills on time? (Credit score and history)</li>
    <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Is the property worth the loan amount? (Appraisal)</li>
</ul>

<p>Plasma income challenges the "capacity" pillar because lenders question whether it is stable and likely to continue.</p>

<h2 id="why-plasma-usually-doesnt-count">Why Plasma Income Usually Doesn't Count</h2>

<p>Mortgage underwriters evaluate income based on stability, predictability, and documentation. Plasma income fails several of these tests:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Not W-2 employment:</strong> Plasma centers don't employ you. You receive a 1099-MISC (if over $600/year), which classifies it as "other income," not wages</li>
    <li><strong>No employer verification:</strong> Lenders cannot call a plasma center to verify your "employment" or confirm ongoing income</li>
    <li><strong>Voluntary and variable:</strong> You can stop donating at any time. Income varies based on how often you go, your weight, and available bonuses. Lenders see this as unreliable</li>
    <li><strong>Health-dependent:</strong> A medical deferral, illness, or change in eligibility could eliminate this income entirely. Lenders view health-dependent income as risky</li>
    <li><strong>Unusual income source:</strong> Many underwriters are unfamiliar with plasma donation income and may simply reject it because they do not know how to categorize it</li>
    <li><strong>Relatively small amounts:</strong> At $6,000-$10,000 per year, plasma income is often too small to significantly move the needle on mortgage qualification</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-it-might-count">When Plasma Income Might Count (The 2-Year Rule)</h2>

<p>Despite the challenges, there are scenarios where a lender MIGHT consider plasma income as supplemental income for mortgage qualification:</p>

<h3>Requirements for Potential Acceptance</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>2+ years of consistent reporting:</strong> You have reported plasma income on your federal tax returns for at least 2 consecutive years</li>
    <li><strong>1099-MISC documentation:</strong> You have 1099-MISC forms from the plasma center(s) for each year</li>
    <li><strong>Stable or increasing amounts:</strong> Your plasma income has been consistent or growing year-over-year. Declining income is a red flag</li>
    <li><strong>Strong primary income:</strong> Plasma income is supplemental to a strong W-2 job or other verified income. It is not your only or primary income source</li>
    <li><strong>Willing lender:</strong> You work with a lender or mortgage broker who understands non-traditional income and is willing to present it to underwriting</li>
</ol>

<h3>How Lenders Calculate Non-Traditional Income</h3>
<p>If a lender does consider your plasma income, they will typically average it over 2 years:</p>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; border-left: 4px solid #0ea5e9; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Example Calculation</p>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Year 1 plasma income: $7,200 | Year 2 plasma income: $8,400</p>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Average: ($7,200 + $8,400) / 2 = $7,800/year = <strong>$650/month added to qualifying income</strong></p>
</div>

<p>An extra $650/month in qualifying income could allow you to qualify for an additional $80,000-$100,000 in mortgage borrowing at current interest rates. But again, getting a lender to accept this calculation is the challenge.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-document">How to Document Plasma Income for a Mortgage</h2>

<p>If you plan to use plasma income in a mortgage application, start building documentation NOW &mdash; ideally 2+ years before you plan to buy:</p>

<h3>Essential Documentation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tax returns (Form 1040):</strong> File plasma income on Schedule 1, Line 8z ("Other income") for at least 2 consecutive years</li>
    <li><strong>1099-MISC forms:</strong> Keep every 1099-MISC from plasma centers. If you earn under $600 from a single center, they may not issue one &mdash; but still report the income</li>
    <li><strong>Bank statements:</strong> Show consistent deposits from the plasma center prepaid card to your bank account. 12-24 months of statements strengthen your case</li>
    <li><strong>Payment history:</strong> Export or screenshot your payment history from the plasma center's app or website</li>
    <li><strong>Written explanation:</strong> Prepare a letter explaining what plasma donation is, how the income is generated, and why it is expected to continue</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pro Tips for Maximizing Acceptance</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Donate consistently:</strong> Sporadic donation patterns weaken your case. Aim for regular twice-weekly donations for at least 2 full calendar years</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer to a bank account:</strong> Regularly transfer plasma card funds to your checking account so the income shows in your bank statements</li>
    <li><strong>Do not co-mingle:</strong> Ideally, transfer plasma funds to a separate savings account or clearly label transfers so the income is easy to track</li>
    <li><strong>Report every dollar:</strong> Even if you do not receive a 1099, report all plasma income on your tax return. Under-reporting or failing to report makes the income invisible to lenders</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternative-strategies">Alternative Strategies for Plasma Donors Seeking Mortgages</h2>

<p>If your lender will not count plasma income, consider these alternative approaches:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use plasma income for the down payment instead:</strong> Save plasma earnings in a dedicated savings account for 12-24 months. Lenders readily accept saved funds for down payments as long as deposits are documented and "seasoned" (in the account for 60+ days)</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce your debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Use plasma income to pay off credit cards, car loans, or student loans before applying. Lower debt improves your DTI ratio more reliably than adding questionable income</li>
    <li><strong>Build your emergency fund:</strong> Having 3-6 months of reserves in savings (funded by plasma) strengthens your application even if the income itself is not counted</li>
    <li><strong>Increase your credit score:</strong> Use plasma income to pay all bills on time and reduce credit utilization. A higher credit score qualifies you for better rates and terms</li>
    <li><strong>Find a co-signer:</strong> A co-signer with strong W-2 income can help you qualify without needing to count plasma income</li>
    <li><strong>Work with a mortgage broker:</strong> Brokers have access to multiple lenders and may find one with flexible underwriting guidelines for non-traditional income</li>
</ol>

        <tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Bank statement loans</strong> are particularly interesting for plasma donors. These non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loans look at your bank deposits over 12-24 months rather than tax returns. If you regularly transfer plasma earnings to your bank account, these deposits become part of your qualifying income. However, bank statement loans typically have higher interest rates (0.5-1.5% above conventional) and require larger down payments.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will mortgage lenders accept plasma donation income?</h3>
<p>Most conventional mortgage lenders will NOT count plasma income for qualification. It is classified as "other income," not W-2 wages, and lenders view it as unstable and health-dependent. However, if you have reported plasma income on your tax returns for 2+ consecutive years with consistent amounts, some lenders or mortgage brokers may consider it as supplemental income on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>How should I report plasma income if I plan to buy a house?</h3>
<p>Report every dollar of plasma income on your federal tax return (Schedule 1, Line 8z) for at least 2 consecutive years before applying for a mortgage. Keep all 1099-MISC forms, transfer plasma card funds to a bank account regularly, and maintain a clear paper trail. Even if a lender ultimately does not count the income, reporting it builds the documentation foundation.</p>

<h3>Can I use plasma income for a down payment?</h3>
<p>Yes. Saving plasma income for a down payment is easier than using it for qualification. Deposit plasma earnings into a dedicated savings account for at least 60 days before applying (this "seasons" the funds). Lenders may ask about the source of large deposits, so keep records of plasma payments and transfers.</p>

<h3>What type of mortgage is best if I have non-traditional income?</h3>
<p>Bank statement loans are designed for borrowers with non-traditional income. They evaluate 12-24 months of bank deposits rather than tax returns. FHA loans also tend to be more flexible with income documentation. Working with a mortgage broker who specializes in non-traditional income gives you the best chance of finding a willing lender.</p>

<h3>Should I stop donating plasma before applying for a mortgage?</h3>
<p>No. Continuing to donate maintains your income history and shows the lender that the income is ongoing. If anything, stopping plasma donations before applying makes your financial picture WORSE because you lose that income stream. Continue donating, continue reporting, and continue building your documentation trail.</p>
