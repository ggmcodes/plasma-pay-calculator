<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>You cannot donate plasma if you have a fever of 99.5°F or higher. Mild cold symptoms with no fever might be acceptable, but you will likely fail vital sign screening. Flu, COVID-19, strep throat, and stomach bugs always result in deferral. You must wait at least 72 hours symptom-free before attempting to donate, and many centers require 7+ days for respiratory infections.</p></div>

<p>Planning to donate plasma but woke up with a scratchy throat and sniffles? You're wondering whether you should bother heading to the center or stay home. The frustrating answer is: it depends on your exact symptoms and vital signs.</p>

<p>This guide covers the exact rules for donating plasma when you're sick. You'll learn which illnesses automatically disqualify you, which vital signs get checked, how long you need to wait after recovering, and how to tell the difference between allergies and an actual cold.</p>

<h2 id="why-sick-deferred">Why Sick Donors Get Deferred</h2>

<p>Plasma centers defer sick donors for three critical reasons, not just because they're being cautious.</p>

<h3>Contamination Risk to Plasma Products</h3>
<p>Your plasma goes to patients with compromised immune systems. Cancer patients receiving immunoglobulin therapy, hemophiliacs getting clotting factors, and burn victims receiving albumin cannot fight off infections like healthy people can.</p>

<p>While plasma undergoes viral inactivation processing, this doesn't eliminate all pathogens. Active bacterial infections like strep throat can contaminate plasma. Even if the final product is safe, centers won't risk it.</p>

<h3>Vital Signs Fall Outside Acceptable Ranges</h3>
<p>Illness affects your body's baseline measurements. Fever elevates temperature. Congestion and inflammation raise pulse and blood pressure. Dehydration from illness lowers blood pressure.</p>

<p>These aren't arbitrary rules. Donating plasma when your vital signs are abnormal stresses your cardiovascular system and increases the risk of adverse reactions during donation.</p>

<h3>Donation Process Worsens Your Illness</h3>
<p>Plasma donation temporarily reduces your blood volume by 600-800ml. Your body replaces the fluid within 24 hours, but this process demands energy and resources.</p>

<p>If you're already fighting an infection, donating plasma diverts resources away from your immune response. You'll feel worse, recover slower, and potentially develop complications.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Centers don't defer sick donors to be difficult. They're protecting plasma recipients, protecting you from adverse reactions, and preventing you from getting sicker. If you're questioning whether you're too sick to donate, you probably are.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="condition-breakdown">Condition-by-Condition Breakdown</h2>

<p>Not all illnesses affect plasma donation the same way. Here's what happens with common conditions.</p>

<h3>Common Cold (Rhinovirus)</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Symptom Severity</th><th>Can You Donate?</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Mild sniffles, no fever</td><td>Maybe</td><td>Depends on vital signs at screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>Congestion, sore throat</td><td>Probably not</td><td>Likely to fail pulse/BP screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cough, body aches</td><td>No</td><td>Will fail screening, risk of secondary infection</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fever (99.5°F+)</td><td>Absolutely not</td><td>Automatic deferral on temperature alone</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Most donors with cold symptoms get deferred even without fever. Congestion raises your heart rate. Post-nasal drip causes coughing during donation. Inflammation affects blood pressure. You'll waste your time and the center's resources by trying.</p>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 72 hours after all symptoms resolve.</p>

<h3>Influenza (Flu)</h3>
<p>You cannot donate plasma with the flu. Period.</p>

<p>Influenza causes high fever (100-104°F), severe body aches, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms. You'll fail temperature screening immediately, and even if you somehow didn't have a fever, the fatigue and dehydration would cause problems during donation.</p>

<p><strong>Flu symptoms that disqualify you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fever and chills</li>
<li>Muscle and body aches</li>
<li>Severe fatigue</li>
<li>Dry cough</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 7 days symptom-free after your fever breaks without fever-reducing medication. Many centers require 10 days for confirmed influenza.</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>Active COVID infection results in immediate deferral, regardless of symptom severity.</p>

<p>Centers take COVID seriously because of the risk to immunocompromised plasma recipients and the documented effects COVID has on blood and plasma composition.</p>

<p><strong>COVID deferral rules (2026):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive test: 10-14 day deferral from symptom onset (varies by center)</li>
<li>Close contact exposure: 7-10 day deferral from last exposure</li>
<li>Symptoms without test: 14 day deferral from symptom onset</li>
<li>Asymptomatic positive test: 10 day deferral from test date</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Some centers have convalescent plasma programs for recently recovered COVID patients. These programs collect antibody-rich plasma for COVID treatment. Ask your center if they participate.</p>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 10-14 days symptom-free depending on center policy.</p>

</section>

<h3>Strep Throat (Bacterial Infection)</h3>
<p>Strep throat is a bacterial infection that absolutely disqualifies you from donation.</p>

<p>Unlike viral colds, strep is caused by Streptococcus bacteria that could theoretically contaminate plasma. Even though plasma processing kills bacteria, centers won't accept donors with active bacterial infections.</p>

<p><strong>Strep symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Severe sore throat (sudden onset)</li>
<li>Pain when swallowing</li>
<li>Fever (often high)</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>White patches on tonsils</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 24-48 hours on antibiotics AND all symptoms resolved. Most centers require 7 days from start of antibiotic treatment.</p>

<h3>Sinus Infection (Sinusitis)</h3>
<p>Sinus infections disqualify you whether they're viral or bacterial.</p>

<p>Sinus infections cause facial pain, pressure, congestion, and often fever. These symptoms will affect your vital signs even if you feel well enough to donate.</p>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 72 hours symptom-free for viral sinusitis. 7 days from antibiotic start for bacterial sinusitis.</p>

<h3>Stomach Bug (Gastroenteritis)</h3>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea result in immediate deferral.</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal illness causes severe dehydration, which makes donation dangerous. Your blood pressure drops, your blood thickens, and you're at high risk for fainting and adverse reactions.</p>

<p><strong>Wait period:</strong> 72 hours after last episode of vomiting or diarrhea AND normal food/fluid intake resumed. Many centers require 7 days.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Allergies</h3>
<p>Allergies generally do not disqualify you from donation.</p>

<p>The key difference: allergies don't cause fever, and your symptoms should be stable and managed with medication. Seasonal allergies from pollen, dust, or pet dander are acceptable as long as your vital signs pass.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptable with allergies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sneezing and runny nose</li>
<li>Itchy, watery eyes</li>
<li>Mild congestion</li>
<li>Taking antihistamines (Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>See the "Allergies vs Cold" section below for details on telling them apart.</strong></p>

<h2 id="vital-signs">The Vital Sign Screening That Catches Illness</h2>

<p>Even if you feel fine enough to donate, your body's vital signs will reveal whether you're actually healthy. Every plasma center checks these measurements during screening, and failing any one of them results in deferral.</p>

<h3>Temperature Requirements</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Temperature Range</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>96.4°F - 99.4°F (36°C - 37.4°C)</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
<tr><td>99.5°F (37.5°C) or higher</td><td>Defer - Fever present</td></tr>
<tr><td>Below 96.4°F (36°C)</td><td>Defer - Hypothermia concern</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even a low-grade fever of 99.5°F indicates your body is fighting infection. This is the most common way sick donors get caught during screening.</p>

<p><strong>Testing method:</strong> Most centers use forehead infrared thermometers or oral digital thermometers. Drinking hot or cold beverages before donation can temporarily affect results.</p>

<h3>Pulse (Heart Rate) Requirements</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Pulse Range (BPM)</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>50 - 100 BPM</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
<tr><td>101+ BPM</td><td>Defer - Tachycardia</td></tr>
<tr><td>Below 50 BPM</td><td>Defer - Bradycardia (unless athletic)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Illness raises your heart rate as your body fights infection. Congestion, inflammation, dehydration, and fever all cause elevated pulse. Decongestant medications also raise heart rate.</p>

<p><strong>How illness affects pulse:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cold/flu: +10-20 BPM from baseline</li>
<li>Fever: +10 BPM per 1°F above normal</li>
<li>Dehydration: +15-25 BPM</li>
<li>Decongestants: +10-30 BPM</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blood Pressure Requirements</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Blood Pressure</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Systolic: 90-180 mmHg</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diastolic: 50-100 mmHg</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
<tr><td>Systolic: 181+ or Diastolic: 101+</td><td>Defer - Hypertension</td></tr>
<tr><td>Systolic: Below 90 or Diastolic: Below 50</td><td>Defer - Hypotension</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Illness affects blood pressure in both directions. Dehydration from stomach bugs drops blood pressure. Congestion and inflammation raise blood pressure. Decongestant medications can spike blood pressure significantly.</p>

<h3>Protein and Hematocrit (Also Checked)</h3>
<p>While not directly related to illness, these can be affected by recent sickness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein:</strong> Must be 6.0 g/dL or higher. Illness and poor eating can lower protein levels.</li>
<li><strong>Hematocrit:</strong> Must be 38% or higher (women) or 39% or higher (men). Dehydration falsely elevates hematocrit, which can mask problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cold-medicines">OTC Cold Medicines and Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>Taking cold medicine doesn't automatically disqualify you, but certain medications will cause you to fail vital sign screening or are explicitly banned.</p>

<h3>Acceptable Cold Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Medication Type</th><th>Examples</th><th>Effect on Donation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Antihistamines</td><td>Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra, Benadryl</td><td>Generally acceptable, minimal vital sign impact</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pain relievers</td><td>Acetaminophen (Tylenol), Ibuprofen (Advil)</td><td>Acceptable, may mask fever (concern)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cough suppressants</td><td>Dextromethorphan (Robitussin DM)</td><td>Usually acceptable if no other symptoms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Expectorants</td><td>Guaifenesin (Mucinex)</td><td>Acceptable</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Problematic Cold Medications</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Medication Type</th><th>Examples</th><th>Why Problematic</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Decongestants</td><td>Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), Phenylephrine</td><td>Raise heart rate and blood pressure, may fail screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>Combination products</td><td>DayQuil, NyQuil, Theraflu</td><td>Contain decongestants and multiple active ingredients</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nasal sprays</td><td>Afrin (oxymetazoline)</td><td>Can elevate blood pressure</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Medication Disclosure Rule</h3>
<p>You must disclose all medications during screening, including over-the-counter cold medicines. Lying about medications can result in permanent deferral if discovered. Centers ask because your safety and plasma quality depend on accurate information.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Fever-Reducer Problem</h3>
<p>Taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever so you can pass temperature screening is dangerous and unethical.</p>

<p>You're masking a symptom that indicates active infection. Your fever is still there - you've just hidden it chemically. The infection remains, the contamination risk remains, and you're putting plasma recipients at risk.</p>

<p>Centers know this trick. They'll ask when you last took fever-reducing medication. If you took it within 4-6 hours, they may defer you automatically.</p>

<h2 id="waiting-period">How Long to Wait After Being Sick</h2>

<p>The waiting period after illness varies by condition severity and center policy, but there are standard minimums.</p>

<h3>Standard Waiting Periods by Condition</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Illness</th><th>Minimum Wait</th><th>Standard Wait</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Mild cold (no fever)</td><td>72 hours symptom-free</td><td>5-7 days symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cold with fever</td><td>7 days symptom-free</td><td>7-10 days symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Influenza</td><td>7 days symptom-free</td><td>10-14 days symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>COVID-19</td><td>10 days from onset</td><td>14 days symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strep throat</td><td>48 hours on antibiotics</td><td>7 days from treatment start</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sinus infection</td><td>72 hours symptom-free</td><td>7 days symptom-free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stomach bug</td><td>72 hours symptom-free</td><td>7 days symptom-free</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>What "Symptom-Free" Actually Means</h3>
<p>Centers define symptom-free as:</p>
<ul>
<li>No fever for 72+ hours without fever-reducing medication</li>
<li>No cough, congestion, or sore throat</li>
<li>No fatigue beyond normal levels</li>
<li>Normal appetite and energy</li>
<li>Returned to normal activities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not symptom-free:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Just a lingering cough" - Still counts as symptoms</li>
<li>"Feeling 90% better" - Wait until 100%</li>
<li>"Only tired in the evenings" - Fatigue counts</li>
<li>"Just clearing my throat a lot" - Respiratory symptoms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Off All Medications</h3>
<p>Most centers require you to be off cold/flu medications for 24-48 hours before donation. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decongestants</li>
<li>Cough suppressants</li>
<li>Combination cold products</li>
<li>Antibiotics (if prescribed - usually need to complete course plus 24-48 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Maintenance antihistamines for allergies are acceptable.</p>

<h3>Why Centers Enforce These Periods</h3>
<p>The waiting periods aren't arbitrary. They're based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viral shedding periods:</strong> You can be contagious even after symptoms resolve</li>
<li><strong>Immune recovery:</strong> Your immune system needs time to fully recover</li>
<li><strong>Medication clearance:</strong> Drugs need to leave your system</li>
<li><strong>Vital sign normalization:</strong> Your body needs time to return to baseline</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="seasonal-patterns">Seasonal Illness Patterns and Planning Donations</h2>

<p>If you donate plasma regularly, you need to plan around cold and flu season to avoid income disruption from deferrals.</p>

<h3>High-Risk Illness Periods (2026)</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Period</th><th>Illness Risk</th><th>Donation Strategy</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>January - March</td><td>Peak flu season</td><td>Get flu shot in October, maximize hygiene, consider N95 masks at center</td></tr>
<tr><td>April - May</td><td>Spring allergies</td><td>Start allergy medication early, easy to confuse with cold</td></tr>
<tr><td>September - November</td><td>Back to school cold surge</td><td>High transmission period, avoid sick people</td></tr>
<tr><td>November - December</td><td>Holiday gatherings, flu starts</td><td>Get flu shot, limit large gatherings if possible</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Preventive Strategies for Regular Donors</h3>
<p>Protect your donation eligibility and income by preventing illness:</p>

<p><strong>Get vaccinated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annual flu shot (September-October) - acceptable to donate after flu shot</li>
<li>COVID boosters per current recommendations</li>
<li>Tdap if due</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the plasma center:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitize hands before and after check-in</li>
<li>Avoid touching face while in waiting area</li>
<li>Sit away from people coughing or sneezing</li>
<li>Bring your own pen for forms</li>
<li>Consider wearing a mask during peak flu season</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General health:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep 7-8 hours per night</li>
<li>Stay hydrated (supports immune function)</li>
<li>Maintain protein intake (supports antibody production)</li>
<li>Wash hands frequently</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with sick people</li>
</ul>

<h3>When You're Exposed to Illness</h3>
<p>If a family member or coworker gets sick, you face a dilemma: donate now before symptoms start, or wait to see if you get sick?</p>

<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> If you were exposed within the last 48 hours and have no symptoms, you can donate. If exposure was 3+ days ago, your incubation period is underway and symptoms could appear during or after donation. Wait 7 days from exposure to be safe.</p>

<p><strong>COVID exposure rules:</strong> Centers may still require 7-10 day deferral for close COVID contact even without symptoms. Check your center's current policy.</p>

<h2 id="allergies-vs-cold">Allergies vs Cold: How to Tell the Difference</h2>

<p>This is the most common confusion at plasma centers. You have sniffles and congestion - is it allergies (probably acceptable) or a cold (defer)? Here's how to tell them apart.</p>

<h3>Symptom Comparison</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Symptom</th><th>Seasonal Allergies</th><th>Common Cold</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Onset</td><td>Immediate when exposed to allergen</td><td>Gradual over 1-3 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Duration</td><td>Weeks to months (entire allergy season)</td><td>7-10 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fever</td><td>Never</td><td>Sometimes (especially in children)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nasal discharge</td><td>Clear, watery, consistent</td><td>Clear at first, then thick yellow/green</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sneezing</td><td>Frequent, repetitive</td><td>Occasional</td></tr>
<tr><td>Itchy eyes</td><td>Very common</td><td>Rare</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sore throat</td><td>Scratchy from post-nasal drip</td><td>Painful, progressive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body aches</td><td>Never</td><td>Common</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fatigue</td><td>Mild, from poor sleep</td><td>Moderate to severe</td></tr>
<tr><td>Timing</td><td>Same time each year, predictable</td><td>Random, after exposure to sick person</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>How to Explain Allergies to Screeners</h3>
<p>If you have seasonal allergies, be proactive during screening:</p>

<p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"I have seasonal allergies, not a cold"</li>
<li>"These symptoms are normal for me during spring/fall"</li>
<li>"I've been taking Claritin for two weeks for allergies"</li>
<li>"No fever, no body aches, no sore throat - just allergy sniffles"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What helps your case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>History of allergies documented in your donor file</li>
<li>Taking prescription or regular OTC allergy medication</li>
<li>Symptoms consistent with previous donations during allergy season</li>
<li>Normal vital signs</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Allergies Become a Problem</h3>
<p>Even with allergies, you can still be deferred if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking decongestants that elevate blood pressure or heart rate</li>
<li>Severe allergies causing fatigue or affecting vital signs</li>
<li>Sinus infection developed on top of allergies</li>
<li>Screener suspects cold rather than allergies</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Pro Tip for Allergy Sufferers</h3>
<p>If you have predictable seasonal allergies, donate during your symptom-free seasons to establish a baseline. When you show up during allergy season with sniffles, your file shows this is normal for you. New donors with mystery sniffles get deferred. Established donors with documented allergies get accepted.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with a cold?</h3>
<p>Not if you have a fever of 99.5°F or higher. Mild cold symptoms like slight congestion with no fever may be acceptable, but the screening vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure) must all pass normal ranges. Most centers defer anyone with active cold symptoms to protect plasma recipients and prevent you from getting sicker. The donation process stresses your body and can worsen illness.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with the flu?</h3>
<p>No. Influenza causes fever, body aches, and fatigue that will cause you to fail vital sign screening. Flu typically produces temperatures of 100-104°F, well above the 99.4°F maximum for donation. You must wait until you are symptom-free for at least 72 hours and off all flu medications before attempting to donate. Most centers require 7-10 days symptom-free for confirmed influenza.</p>

<h3>How long after being sick can you donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Minimum 72 hours (3 days) after all symptoms resolve and you stop taking medications. Many centers require 7 days symptom-free for respiratory infections like colds and flu. COVID-19 requires 10-14 days symptom-free depending on the center. Bacterial infections treated with antibiotics require completion of treatment plus 24-48 hours. "Symptom-free" means completely free of fever, cough, congestion, fatigue, and all other symptoms - not "feeling mostly better."</p>

<h3>What temperature disqualifies you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>99.5°F (37.5°C) or higher will result in deferral. Normal acceptable range is 96.4°F to 99.4°F (36°C to 37.4°C). Even a low-grade fever of 99.5°F means you cannot donate that day. Temperatures below 96.4°F also result in deferral due to hypothermia concerns. Taking fever-reducing medication to pass temperature screening is dangerous, unethical, and may result in permanent deferral if discovered.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with allergies?</h3>
<p>Yes, seasonal allergies generally do not disqualify you as long as your vital signs are normal. Inform the screener you have allergies, not a cold. Antihistamines like Claritin, Zyrtec, or Allegra are acceptable medications. Avoid decongestants (Sudafed, phenylephrine) that may elevate blood pressure and heart rate, causing you to fail vital sign screening. Having documented allergies in your donor history helps establish that seasonal symptoms are normal for you.</p>

<h3>Can cold medicine disqualify you from plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Some can. Decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) commonly found in Sudafed, DayQuil, and NyQuil can elevate heart rate and blood pressure, causing you to fail screening. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are usually acceptable but may mask fever, which is a concern. Antihistamines for allergies are generally acceptable. Always disclose all medications during screening - lying about medications can result in permanent deferral. Most centers require you off cold medications for 24-48 hours before donation.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with COVID-19?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. Active COVID infection results in immediate deferral. You must be symptom-free for 10-14 days (varies by center) and many centers require a negative test before allowing donation. Close contact exposure to COVID may require 7-10 day deferral even without symptoms. Some centers have specific convalescent plasma programs for recently recovered COVID patients to collect antibody-rich plasma for treatment purposes. Check with your center if you recently recovered from COVID.</p>

<h3>What happens if you try to donate plasma while sick?</h3>
<p>You will be deferred during vital sign screening when your temperature, pulse, or blood pressure falls outside acceptable ranges. Fever above 99.4°F results in automatic deferral. Elevated heart rate from congestion or decongestants fails pulse screening. This wastes your time traveling to the center and wastes the center's resources processing your screening. You also risk spreading illness to staff and other donors in the waiting area. It's better to wait until you're fully recovered.</p>
