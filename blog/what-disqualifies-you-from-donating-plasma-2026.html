{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What permanently disqualifies you from donating plasma?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Permanent disqualifications include HIV positive status, Hepatitis B or C infection, certain cancers (leukemia, lymphoma), history of IV drug use for non-medical purposes, organ or tissue transplant recipient, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) or family history, and certain chronic conditions. These are FDA-mandated safety measures to protect plasma recipients."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long after getting a tattoo can I donate plasma?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Deferral periods vary by state and center. In states with unregulated tattoo facilities, you must wait 3-12 months after getting a tattoo. In states with regulated facilities (like California, New York), you may be able to donate immediately if the shop is licensed and follows state requirements. Always bring documentation from your tattoo artist."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I donate plasma if I'm on antibiotics?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, you must wait until you complete your antibiotic course plus an additional 72 hours (3 days) to be symptom-free. This ensures the infection is fully cleared and you're healthy enough to donate. The specific medication and reason for taking it may also affect eligibility."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What protein level do I need to donate plasma?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most centers require total protein of at least 6.0 g/dL, though some require 6.2-6.5 g/dL. Low protein is one of the most common reasons for same-day deferral. Eating high-protein foods (eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken) before donation can help you meet requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I donate plasma if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Pregnancy is an automatic deferral. After giving birth, you must wait 6 weeks minimum, and if breastfeeding, you must wait until 6 weeks after you stop nursing. This protects both mother and baby from potential nutritional depletion."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What countries disqualify you from plasma donation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Travel to malaria-risk countries (parts of Africa, Asia, Central/South America) results in 12-month to 3-year deferral depending on the region. Time spent in the UK or Europe during mad cow disease outbreaks (1980-1996) may result in permanent deferral. Check FDA guidelines for specific country restrictions."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What blood pressure is too high to donate plasma?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most centers require blood pressure below 180/100 mmHg at time of donation. If your reading is above this, you'll be deferred that day. Controlled high blood pressure (on medication) is usually acceptable if readings are within range. Very low blood pressure (below 90/50) may also disqualify you."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can medications disqualify you from donating plasma?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Some medications cause deferral: Accutane (isotretinoin) requires 1-month wait after stopping, Propecia (finasteride) requires 1-month wait, blood thinners like warfarin are disqualifying, and experimental drugs or recent vaccines may require waiting periods. Most common medications (blood pressure, antidepressants, birth control) are acceptable. Always disclose all medications during screening."}}]}

<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p>Most plasma donation deferrals are temporary and fixable. Common reasons include low protein, recent tattoos, travel, or medications. Only 5-7% of deferrals are permanent (HIV, Hepatitis B/C, certain cancers). If deferred, the center will tell you exactly why and when you can return.</p></div>

<p>Getting turned away from a plasma donation can be frustrating, especially if you were counting on that income. The good news is that most disqualifications are temporary and can be resolved.</p>

<p>This guide covers all 23 major disqualification reasons, separated into permanent vs temporary deferrals, with specific timelines and solutions for each. All information is based on FDA blood establishment regulations and current 2026 plasma center screening protocols.</p>

<h2 id="permanent">Permanent Disqualifications</h2>

<p>These conditions result in indefinite deferral from plasma donation. They are FDA-mandated safety measures to protect plasma recipients who receive products made from donated plasma.</p>

<h3>1. HIV Positive Status</h3>
<p>Anyone who has tested positive for HIV antibodies or HIV antigen/antibody tests is permanently deferred. This includes both symptomatic AIDS and asymptomatic HIV infection.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Even with undetectable viral loads, FDA regulations prohibit HIV-positive individuals from donating plasma to prevent any transmission risk.</p>

<h3>2. Hepatitis B or C Infection</h3>
<p>A positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C antibody results in permanent deferral.</p>

<p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> If you had Hepatitis A (different virus), you can donate once fully recovered. Hepatitis B vaccination is fine and does not disqualify you.</p>

<h3>3. History of IV Drug Use</h3>
<p>Any non-medical intravenous drug use at any point in your life results in permanent deferral.</p>

<p><strong>What counts:</strong> This includes heroin, methamphetamine, or any recreational drug injected with a needle. It does NOT include prescribed IV medications, insulin injections, or other medical injections.</p>

<h3>4. Certain Cancers</h3>
<p>Blood cancers including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma result in permanent deferral. Most other cancers require waiting until treatment is complete, with varying deferral periods.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Completely removed basal or squamous cell skin cancers and early-stage cervical cancer may not permanently disqualify you after a waiting period.</p>

<h3>5. Organ or Tissue Transplant Recipient</h3>
<p>If you have received an organ transplant (kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas) or a tissue/bone marrow transplant, you are permanently deferred.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Transplant recipients are on immunosuppressive medications and may have been exposed to diseases from the donor organ.</p>

<h3>6. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)</h3>
<p>Anyone diagnosed with CJD or variant CJD (mad cow disease), or who has a blood relative diagnosed with CJD, is permanently deferred.</p>

<h3>7. Babesiosis</h3>
<p>This tick-borne parasitic disease results in permanent deferral in most cases, as the parasite can remain in blood indefinitely.</p>

<h3>8. Extended Stay in UK/Europe (Mad Cow Disease Risk)</h3>
<p>Time spent in the United Kingdom or certain European countries during specific periods may result in permanent deferral:</p>

<ul>
<li>3+ months in UK between 1980-1996</li>
<li>5+ years cumulative in Europe between 1980-present</li>
<li>Time on US military bases in Europe during high-risk periods</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Deferral policies vary by center and are updated as FDA guidance changes. Some centers have relaxed these restrictions in recent years.</p>

<h2 id="temporary">Temporary Disqualifications</h2>

<p>These are the most common deferrals. The good news is you can donate again once the waiting period ends or the condition is resolved.</p>

<h3>9. Recent Tattoo or Piercing</h3>

<p><strong>Deferral period:</strong> Varies significantly by state and center policy.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>State Regulation Status</th><th>Typical Deferral</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Regulated state (licensed shops)</td><td>0-3 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unregulated state</td><td>12 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tattoo in another country</td><td>12 months</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Regulated states</strong> (can donate sooner if from licensed shop): California, New York, Illinois, Texas, Florida, and others with state tattoo licensing.</p>

<p><strong>What you need:</strong> Bring documentation from your tattoo artist showing the shop is state-licensed and follows health department regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Piercings:</strong> Ear lobe piercings done with single-use equipment usually don't cause deferral. Body piercings follow same rules as tattoos.</p>

<h3>10. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</h3>

<p><strong>During pregnancy:</strong> Automatic deferral.</p>

<p><strong>After giving birth:</strong> Minimum 6-week waiting period.</p>

<p><strong>While breastfeeding:</strong> Must wait until 6 weeks after you stop nursing.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Pregnancy and nursing deplete protein, iron, and other nutrients. Plasma donation could further compromise maternal and infant health.</p>

<h3>11. Recent Surgery or Medical Procedures</h3>

<p>Deferral periods vary by procedure type:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Procedure</th><th>Typical Deferral</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Minor outpatient surgery</td><td>2-4 weeks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Major surgery (hospital stay)</td><td>3-6 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dental work (cleaning, filling)</td><td>24-72 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tooth extraction</td><td>3-7 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Root canal</td><td>7-14 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Endoscopy/colonoscopy</td><td>2-4 weeks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Biopsy</td><td>2-4 weeks</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your body needs time to fully heal before losing plasma protein and antibodies through donation.</p>

<h3>12. Taking Antibiotics</h3>

<p><strong>Deferral:</strong> Must complete full course of antibiotics PLUS 72 hours (3 days) symptom-free.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The antibiotic indicates an active infection. Centers need assurance the infection is completely cleared and you're healthy enough to donate.</p>

<p><strong>What counts:</strong> All antibiotics for bacterial infections. Topical antibiotics (antibiotic ointment) typically don't cause deferral.</p>

<h3>13. Travel to Malaria-Risk Areas</h3>

<p>Travel to countries with malaria risk results in 12-month to 3-year deferral depending on the region and your specific activities.</p>

<p><strong>High-risk regions include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of sub-Saharan Africa</li>
<li>Parts of Central and South America</li>
<li>South and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>Parts of Middle East</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deferral length depends on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you took anti-malaria medication</li>
<li>Length of stay</li>
<li>Specific country/region</li>
<li>Whether you had symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Travel tip:</strong> If you donate regularly for income, check CDC malaria risk maps before booking international travel.</p>

<h3>14. Blood Transfusion or Blood Products</h3>

<p><strong>Deferral:</strong> 12 months after receiving blood, platelets, plasma, or cryoprecipitate.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Transfusions carry small risk of disease transmission. The 12-month window allows time for any potential infections to become detectable.</p>

<h3>15. Sexual Activity Risk Factors</h3>

<p>FDA guidelines include specific deferral periods based on sexual activity that may increase risk of HIV or other bloodborne infections:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New sexual partner in past 3 months:</strong> May require additional testing or short deferral</li>
<li><strong>Potential STI exposure:</strong> Varies by situation and testing results</li>
<li><strong>Men who have sex with men (MSM):</strong> FDA updated guidelines in 2023; deferral periods reduced significantly but individual risk assessment applies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> All donors are asked questions about sexual history. Answer honestly - all information is confidential and required for recipient safety.</p>

<h3>16. Recent Vaccination</h3>

<p>Most vaccinations don't cause deferral, but some require short waiting periods:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Vaccine Type</th><th>Typical Deferral</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Flu shot, COVID vaccine</td><td>No deferral</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tetanus, hepatitis B</td><td>No deferral</td></tr>
<tr><td>Live virus vaccines (MMR, chickenpox)</td><td>2-4 weeks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Smallpox vaccine</td><td>2 months if no complications</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rabies vaccine (exposure treatment)</td><td>12 months</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>17. Recent Illness</h3>

<p><strong>Cold or flu:</strong> Wait until symptom-free for 72 hours.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> Most centers require symptom-free for 10-14 days and negative test or meeting CDC recovery guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Stomach bug:</strong> Wait until symptom-free for 48-72 hours.</p>

<p><strong>General rule:</strong> You must be feeling completely well with no fever, no antibiotics, and no active symptoms.</p>

<h3>18. Accutane (Isotretinoin) or Certain Acne Medications</h3>

<p><strong>Deferral:</strong> 1 month after stopping Accutane (isotretinoin).</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Accutane can cause birth defects. Although plasma isn't used for direct transfusion, FDA requires this precaution.</p>

<p><strong>Other acne medications:</strong> Topical treatments and most oral antibiotics (after infection clear) are fine.</p>

<h3>19. Propecia (Finasteride) for Hair Loss</h3>

<p><strong>Deferral:</strong> 1 month after stopping finasteride.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Similar to Accutane, this medication can cause birth defects and requires a waiting period after discontinuation.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="day-of">Day-of-Screening Deferrals</h2>

<p>These are the most common reasons donors get turned away at their appointment. The good news is most are easily preventable with proper preparation.</p>

<h3>20. Low Protein Level</h3>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Most centers require total protein of at least 6.0 g/dL, though some require 6.2-6.5 g/dL.</p>

<p><strong>Why it happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not eating enough protein before donation</li>
<li>Donating too frequently without proper nutrition</li>
<li>Vegetarian/vegan diet without proper planning</li>
<li>Recent illness</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat high-protein meal 2-3 hours before donation</li>
<li>Good options: eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken breast, protein shake</li>
<li>Consistent protein intake on non-donation days</li>
<li>Consider protein supplements if chronically low</li>
</ul>

<h3>21. Low Hematocrit/Hemoglobin</h3>

<p><strong>Requirements vary by gender:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Men:</strong> Hematocrit 38% or higher (hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL)</li>
<li><strong>Women:</strong> Hematocrit 36% or higher (hemoglobin 12.0 g/dL)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron deficiency (most common)</li>
<li>Donating too frequently</li>
<li>Heavy menstrual periods</li>
<li>Poor diet</li>
<li>Recent blood loss</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take iron supplements (18-65mg daily between donations)</li>
<li>Eat iron-rich foods: red meat, spinach, beans, fortified cereals</li>
<li>Take vitamin C with iron to boost absorption</li>
<li>Wait longer between donations (3-4 days instead of 2)</li>
</ul>

<h3>22. Blood Pressure Too High or Too Low</h3>

<p><strong>Typical limits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 180/100 mmHg</li>
<li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 90/50 mmHg</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High blood pressure causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>White coat syndrome (anxiety)</li>
<li>Caffeine before donation</li>
<li>Uncontrolled hypertension</li>
<li>Stress or rushing to appointment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Low blood pressure causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dehydration</li>
<li>Not eating enough before donation</li>
<li>Some medications</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid caffeine 2 hours before donation</li>
<li>Arrive early and relax</li>
<li>Stay well-hydrated</li>
<li>Eat a balanced meal before donating</li>
<li>If on blood pressure medication, ensure it's controlled</li>
</ul>

<h3>23. Pulse Too High or Too Low</h3>

<p><strong>Typical acceptable range:</strong> 50-100 beats per minute.</p>

<p><strong>High pulse causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Caffeine</li>
<li>Rushing to appointment</li>
<li>Dehydration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Low pulse:</strong> Very athletic individuals may have naturally low resting heart rates. This is usually acceptable if you feel fine.</p>

<h3>Fever</h3>

<p><strong>Limit:</strong> Temperature above 99.5°F (37.5°C) results in deferral.</p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Wait until fever-free for at least 72 hours before attempting to donate.</p>

<h3>Lipemia (Fatty Plasma)</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Visible fat in plasma making it appear milky white instead of clear yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eating high-fat meal before donation</li>
<li>Consistently high-fat diet</li>
<li>Some metabolic conditions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid fatty foods 24 hours before donation</li>
<li>Choose lean proteins instead of fried foods</li>
<li>Skip fast food before donation day</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="medications">Medication Restrictions</h2>

<p>Most medications are acceptable for plasma donation, but some cause temporary or permanent deferral.</p>

<h3>Medications That Are Usually Fine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)</li>
<li>Birth control pills</li>
<li>Thyroid medications</li>
<li>Diabetes medications (including insulin)</li>
<li>Asthma inhalers</li>
<li>Antihistamines/allergy medications</li>
<li>Pain relievers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medications That Cause Deferral</h3>

<p><strong>Blood thinners:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Warfarin (Coumadin) - permanent deferral</li>
<li>Heparin - temporary while taking</li>
<li>Plavix, Xarelto - policies vary by center</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> Aspirin is usually fine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accutane and Propecia:</strong> Covered above (1-month deferral after stopping).</p>

<p><strong>Experimental medications:</strong> Any clinical trial drugs result in deferral until cleared by medical director.</p>

<p><strong>Growth hormone:</strong> Human-derived growth hormone (before 1985) results in permanent deferral. Synthetic growth hormone requires evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Psoriasis medications:</strong> Some biologics may cause temporary deferral. Check with center.</p>

<h3>Always Disclose All Medications</h3>

<p>Even over-the-counter supplements and herbal remedies should be mentioned during screening. Failing to disclose medications can result in permanent deferral if discovered later.</p>

<h2 id="prevention">How to Prevent Common Deferrals</h2>

<p>About 70% of same-day deferrals can be prevented with proper preparation. Here's how to maximize your chances of successfully donating.</p>

<h3>The Day Before Donation</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>24-Hour Prep Checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drink 64+ oz of water throughout the day</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol (dehydrating and can affect protein levels)</li>
<li>Avoid high-fat foods (prevents lipemia)</li>
<li>Get 7-8 hours of sleep</li>
<li>Take iron supplement if you use them</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Morning of Donation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eat a high-protein breakfast 2-3 hours before:</strong> Eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake, turkey sausage</li>
<li><strong>Drink 16-20 oz of water:</strong> Don't chug right before - spread it over 1-2 hours</li>
<li><strong>Avoid caffeine 2 hours before:</strong> Can raise blood pressure and pulse</li>
<li><strong>Don't smoke before donation:</strong> Can affect blood pressure and oxygen levels</li>
<li><strong>Take any regular medications as prescribed:</strong> Don't skip blood pressure meds thinking it will help</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hydration Strategy</h3>

<p>Proper hydration is the single most important factor for easy, fast donations without deferral.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 days before:</strong> Start increasing water intake</li>
<li><strong>Day before:</strong> Drink 64-80 oz throughout the day</li>
<li><strong>Morning of:</strong> 16-20 oz, finished 30+ minutes before arrival</li>
<li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Chugging water right before donation (can dilute protein reading)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nutrition for Regular Donors</h3>

<p>If you donate twice weekly, you need to actively support your body's protein and iron production.</p>

<p><strong>Daily protein target:</strong> 80-100g for regular donors.</p>

<p><strong>Best protein sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken breast - 30g per 4 oz</li>
<li>Greek yogurt - 15-20g per cup</li>
<li>Eggs - 6g per egg</li>
<li>Protein shakes - 20-30g per serving</li>
<li>Lean beef - 25g per 4 oz</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Iron supplementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>18mg daily for women, 8-18mg for men</li>
<li>Take with vitamin C (orange juice) for better absorption</li>
<li>Take on non-donation days or evening of donation day</li>
<li>Don't take iron immediately before donation (can cause false high reading)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Timing Between Donations</h3>

<p>While FDA allows plasma donation every 48 hours, your body may need more recovery time.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum:</strong> 2 days (48 hours).</p>

<p><strong>Recommended for most people:</strong> 3-4 days between donations.</p>

<p><strong>Signs you need more recovery time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frequently failing protein checks</li>
<li>Feeling fatigued after donations</li>
<li>Bruising easily</li>
<li>Low hematocrit readings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to Do If You're Deferred</h2>

<p>Getting deferred doesn't mean you can never donate. Here's what to do based on the type of deferral.</p>

<h3>Same-Day Deferral (Protein, Hematocrit, Vitals)</h3>

<p><strong>What happens:</strong> You'll be told you can return after a certain period (usually 2-7 days).</p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ask staff exactly what was low/high and by how much</li>
<li>Ask for specific advice on how to fix it</li>
<li>Follow the preparation steps above more carefully</li>
<li>Consider waiting an extra day or two before trying again</li>
<li>Don't get discouraged - this happens to nearly every regular donor at some point</li>
</ol>

<h3>Short-Term Deferral (Illness, Antibiotics, Tattoo)</h3>

<p><strong>What happens:</strong> You'll receive a deferral letter or notification with a specific return date.</p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Note the exact return date in your calendar</li>
<li>Keep any required documentation (tattoo license, medical clearance, etc.)</li>
<li>Contact the center if you have questions about your return date</li>
<li>Don't attempt to donate at a different center during deferral period (centers share information)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Long-Term or Indefinite Deferral</h3>

<p><strong>What happens:</strong> You'll receive official notification, usually by mail.</p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Read the notification carefully for the specific reason</li>
<li>If it's a test result (like antibody test), follow up with your doctor</li>
<li>You can request more information from the center's medical director</li>
<li>Ask if there's any circumstance under which you could be reinstated</li>
<li>All deferral information is confidential</li>
</ol>

<h3>If You Disagree With the Deferral</h3>

<p>If you believe you were deferred in error:</p>

<ol>
<li>Request to speak with the center manager or medical director</li>
<li>Bring documentation (test results from your doctor, medication lists, etc.)</li>
<li>Ask for specific FDA regulation or company policy that applies to your case</li>
<li>Remember that staff are following FDA regulations and cannot make exceptions for individual cases</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What permanently disqualifies you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Permanent disqualifications include HIV positive status, Hepatitis B or C infection, certain cancers (leukemia, lymphoma), history of IV drug use for non-medical purposes, organ or tissue transplant recipient, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) or family history, and certain chronic conditions. These are FDA-mandated safety measures to protect plasma recipients.</p>

<h3>How long after getting a tattoo can I donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Deferral periods vary by state and center. In states with unregulated tattoo facilities, you must wait 3-12 months after getting a tattoo. In states with regulated facilities (like California, New York), you may be able to donate immediately if the shop is licensed and follows state requirements. Always bring documentation from your tattoo artist.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I'm on antibiotics?</h3>
<p>No, you must wait until you complete your antibiotic course plus an additional 72 hours (3 days) to be symptom-free. This ensures the infection is fully cleared and you're healthy enough to donate. The specific medication and reason for taking it may also affect eligibility.</p>

<h3>What protein level do I need to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most centers require total protein of at least 6.0 g/dL, though some require 6.2-6.5 g/dL. Low protein is one of the most common reasons for same-day deferral. Eating high-protein foods (eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken) before donation can help you meet requirements.</p>

<h3>Can I donate plasma if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?</h3>
<p>No. Pregnancy is an automatic deferral. After giving birth, you must wait 6 weeks minimum, and if breastfeeding, you must wait until 6 weeks after you stop nursing. This protects both mother and baby from potential nutritional depletion.</p>

<h3>What countries disqualify you from plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Travel to malaria-risk countries (parts of Africa, Asia, Central/South America) results in 12-month to 3-year deferral depending on the region. Time spent in the UK or Europe during mad cow disease outbreaks (1980-1996) may result in permanent deferral. Check FDA guidelines for specific country restrictions.</p>

<h3>What blood pressure is too high to donate plasma?</h3>
<p>Most centers require blood pressure below 180/100 mmHg at time of donation. If your reading is above this, you'll be deferred that day. Controlled high blood pressure (on medication) is usually acceptable if readings are within range. Very low blood pressure (below 90/50) may also disqualify you.</p>

<h3>Can medications disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Some medications cause deferral: Accutane (isotretinoin) requires 1-month wait after stopping, Propecia (finasteride) requires 1-month wait, blood thinners like warfarin are disqualifying, and experimental drugs or recent vaccines may require waiting periods. Most common medications (blood pressure, antidepressants, birth control) are acceptable. Always disclose all medications during screening.</p>
