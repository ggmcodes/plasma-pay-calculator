<div class="highlight-box" id="quick-answer"><h3>Quick Answer</h3><p><strong>Most autoimmune diseases disqualify you from donating plasma.</strong> Conditions like lupus, multiple sclerosis, and Type 1 diabetes are almost always a permanent deferral. However, some mild or well-controlled autoimmune conditions -- like celiac disease managed by diet, mild psoriasis with topical treatment only, or stable Hashimoto's thyroiditis on levothyroxine -- may be accepted at certain centers on a case-by-case basis. The biggest disqualifying factor is often the <strong>medication</strong> you take, not just the diagnosis itself.</p></div>

<p>If you have an autoimmune disease, you have probably wondered whether you can still donate plasma and earn extra income. The answer is not a simple yes or no. It depends on your specific condition, how severe it is, what medications you take, and which donation center you visit.</p>

<p>This guide breaks down the eligibility rules for every major autoimmune condition, explains why these restrictions exist, and tells you exactly what to expect at the screening. If one center turns you away, you will also learn about alternatives -- including specialized clinical trials that may actually <em>want</em> your plasma specifically because of your autoimmune antibodies.</p>

<h2 id="why-autoimmune-matters">Why Autoimmune Conditions Matter for Plasma Donation</h2>

<p>To understand the eligibility rules, you need to understand what plasma is used for and why autoimmune diseases create problems.</p>

<h3>What Happens to Your Donated Plasma</h3>

<p>Donated plasma is not simply transfused into another person the way whole blood might be. Instead, it goes through a manufacturing process called fractionation, where it is separated into specific protein components. These components are used to create life-saving therapies for people with immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, burn victims, and other serious conditions.</p>

<p>The key products derived from plasma include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immunoglobulins (IVIG):</strong> Antibodies used to treat immune deficiencies and certain neurological conditions</li>
<li><strong>Albumin:</strong> Used for burn victims, surgical patients, and liver disease</li>
<li><strong>Clotting factors:</strong> Used for hemophilia patients</li>
<li><strong>Alpha-1 antitrypsin:</strong> Used for genetic lung disease</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Autoantibody Problem</h3>

<p>When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system produces <strong>autoantibodies</strong> -- antibodies that mistakenly target your own body's healthy tissues. These autoantibodies circulate in your blood plasma. Different autoimmune diseases produce different types of autoantibodies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lupus:</strong> Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies</li>
<li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong> Rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP antibodies</li>
<li><strong>Multiple sclerosis:</strong> Various antibodies targeting myelin</li>
<li><strong>Type 1 diabetes:</strong> Anti-GAD antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies</li>
</ul>

<p>When your plasma is pooled with thousands of other donations during manufacturing, these autoantibodies could end up in the final therapeutic product. A patient receiving IVIG therapy -- who already has a weakened immune system -- could potentially be harmed by receiving someone else's autoantibodies. This is the core reason most autoimmune diseases are disqualifying.</p>

<h3>The Medication Problem</h3>

<p>Beyond the autoantibodies, there is a second major concern: <strong>immunosuppressant medications</strong>. Most moderate to severe autoimmune diseases require treatment with drugs that suppress the immune system. These medications can remain in your bloodstream and end up in your plasma, potentially affecting the safety of plasma-derived products.</p>

<p>Even if your autoimmune condition is mild enough that your autoantibodies might not be a problem, the medications you take to control it can independently disqualify you. This is why medication status is often the deciding factor.</p>

<h2 id="condition-breakdown">Condition-by-Condition Breakdown</h2>

<p>Below is a detailed breakdown of the most common autoimmune diseases and how they affect your eligibility to donate plasma. Keep in mind that policies can vary between centers, so the information below represents the general consensus across major plasma companies in the United States as of 2026.</p>

<h3>Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Almost Always Disqualifying</h3>
<p>Lupus is a <strong>permanent deferral</strong> at virtually all plasma donation centers. There are no known exceptions at major commercial plasma companies.</p>
</div>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most complex autoimmune diseases, and it is one of the clearest disqualifications for plasma donation. Lupus causes your immune system to produce a wide variety of autoantibodies -- anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, antiphospholipid, and others -- that attack multiple organ systems throughout your body.</p>

<p>The sheer number and diversity of autoantibodies produced in lupus make your plasma unsuitable for therapeutic use. Additionally, lupus is almost always treated with immunosuppressant medications such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), mycophenolate (CellCept), azathioprine (Imuran), or biologics like belimumab (Benlysta), all of which are independently disqualifying.</p>

<p>This deferral applies regardless of how well-controlled your lupus is, whether you are in remission, or how mild your symptoms are. If you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will be permanently deferred.</p>

<h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Depends on Severity and Medication</h3>
<p>Mild RA managed with NSAIDs only <strong>may be accepted</strong> at some centers. RA treated with methotrexate, biologics, or other immunosuppressants is <strong>disqualifying</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Rheumatoid arthritis falls into a gray area. The condition itself produces autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies), but the real determining factor is usually your treatment regimen.</p>

<p>If your RA is mild and you manage it with over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen, some centers may accept you. NSAIDs are not immunosuppressants and are generally permitted for plasma donation.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of RA patients eventually require disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologics. If you take any of the following, you will be deferred:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Methotrexate</strong> -- the most common first-line DMARD for RA</li>
<li><strong>Biologics:</strong> Humira (adalimumab), Enbrel (etanercept), Remicade (infliximab), Orencia (abatacept), Actemra (tocilizumab)</li>
<li><strong>JAK inhibitors:</strong> Xeljanz (tofacitinib), Rinvoq (upadacitinib)</li>
<li><strong>Other DMARDs:</strong> Leflunomide (Arava), sulfasalazine at high doses</li>
</ul>

<p>When you go for screening, be completely honest about your medications. The medical staff will review each one and make a determination. Even if you stopped taking an immunosuppressant recently, there may be a required washout period before you are eligible.</p>

<h3>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Almost Always Disqualifying</h3>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is a <strong>permanent deferral</strong> at most plasma donation centers, regardless of disease type or activity level.</p>
</div>

<p>Multiple sclerosis is generally a permanent disqualification for plasma donation. MS involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, and the resulting antibodies in your plasma are a safety concern for recipients.</p>

<p>Beyond the autoantibodies, virtually all MS disease-modifying therapies are disqualifying. This includes injectable medications like interferon beta (Avonex, Rebif) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), oral medications like fingolimod (Gilenya) and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and infusion therapies like natalizumab (Tysabri) and ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).</p>

<p>Even people with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or very early MS who are not yet on treatment are typically deferred because of the underlying disease process. Some rare exceptions may exist for benign MS that has been inactive for many years without treatment, but this is not standard practice at major centers.</p>

<h3>Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (IBD)</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Depends Heavily on Treatment</h3>
<p>Mild IBD managed with mesalamine or diet alone <strong>may be accepted</strong>. IBD treated with biologics, immunomodulators, or steroids is <strong>disqualifying</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases -- Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- occupy a middle ground. These conditions are autoimmune in nature, but the severity range is wide, and treatment approaches vary significantly.</p>

<p>If you have mild ulcerative colitis or mild Crohn's disease that is well-controlled with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mesalamine (Asacol, Lialda, Pentasa):</strong> This is an anti-inflammatory, not an immunosuppressant, and is often permitted</li>
<li><strong>Diet modifications alone:</strong> No medication concerns</li>
<li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> Not a medication concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Then some centers may accept you, especially if you have been in remission for an extended period.</p>

<p>However, moderate to severe IBD is typically treated with medications that will disqualify you:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Biologics:</strong> Remicade (infliximab), Humira (adalimumab), Entyvio (vedolizumab), Stelara (ustekinumab), Skyrizi (risankizumab)</li>
<li><strong>Immunomodulators:</strong> Azathioprine (Imuran), 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate</li>
<li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> Prednisone, budesonide (Entocort) at high doses</li>
<li><strong>JAK inhibitors:</strong> Xeljanz (tofacitinib)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have had IBD-related surgery (bowel resection, colectomy), the surgical history alone does not disqualify you, but the underlying disease and any ongoing medications will be evaluated.</p>

<h3>Psoriasis</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Mild Cases May Be Accepted</h3>
<p>Mild psoriasis with <strong>topical treatment only</strong> is often accepted. Moderate to severe psoriasis requiring systemic medications is <strong>disqualifying</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Psoriasis is one of the autoimmune conditions most likely to be accepted for plasma donation, but only if it is mild. The key factors are the extent of skin involvement and your treatment.</p>

<p>You are more likely to be accepted if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your psoriasis affects a small area of your body (less than 10% of skin surface)</li>
<li>You use only topical treatments: corticosteroid creams, vitamin D analogs (calcipotriene), or moisturizers</li>
<li>You have no active plaques at the venipuncture site (the area where the needle is inserted)</li>
<li>Your psoriasis has been stable for an extended period</li>
</ul>

<p>You will likely be deferred if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You take biologic medications: Cosentyx (secukinumab), Skyrizi (risankizumab), Tremfya (guselkumab), Taltz (ixekizumab), Humira, Enbrel</li>
<li>You take oral systemic medications: methotrexate, apremilast (Otezla), acitretin (Soriatane)</li>
<li>You use phototherapy (light therapy) -- policies vary on this</li>
<li>You have active plaques near the donation site, which raises infection concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>One important note: if you have psoriatic arthritis in addition to skin psoriasis, the eligibility picture changes significantly because psoriatic arthritis almost always requires systemic treatment.</p>

<h3>Celiac Disease</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Often Accepted</h3>
<p>Celiac disease controlled with a <strong>gluten-free diet</strong> and no active symptoms is accepted at <strong>many centers</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Celiac disease is one of the most commonly accepted autoimmune conditions for plasma donation. The reason is straightforward: celiac disease is managed through diet, not immunosuppressant medications.</p>

<p>If you have celiac disease and meet these criteria, you are likely eligible:</p>

<ul>
<li>You follow a strict gluten-free diet</li>
<li>You have no active gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, significant bloating)</li>
<li>You are not taking any immunosuppressant medications for celiac or related conditions</li>
<li>Your weight meets the minimum requirement (typically 110 pounds)</li>
<li>You are not anemic (celiac can cause iron deficiency; your hemoglobin will be tested at each visit)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main risk factor for celiac donors is anemia. Celiac disease can impair iron absorption, and frequent plasma donation can further lower iron stores. If your hemoglobin drops below the center's minimum threshold (usually 12.5 g/dL for women, 13.0 g/dL for men), you will be temporarily deferred until your levels recover.</p>

<p>If you have celiac disease, consider taking an iron supplement and eating iron-rich foods regularly to maintain your hemoglobin levels. Discuss this with your doctor before starting any supplement.</p>

<h3>Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Graves' Disease</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: May Be Accepted With Stable Thyroid Levels</h3>
<p>Hashimoto's or Graves' disease with <strong>stable thyroid levels</strong> on standard thyroid medication is accepted at <strong>some centers</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Autoimmune thyroid conditions are among the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting an estimated 5% of the U.S. population. The good news is that they are also among the most likely to be accepted for plasma donation.</p>

<p><strong>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</strong> causes an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and is treated with thyroid hormone replacement, typically levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl). Levothyroxine is not an immunosuppressant -- it simply replaces the hormone your thyroid is not making enough of. Because of this, levothyroxine does not trigger a medication deferral at most centers.</p>

<p><strong>Graves' disease</strong> causes an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) and is treated with antithyroid medications like methimazole (Tapazole) or propylthiouracil (PTU), radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroid surgery. The eligibility picture for Graves' disease is more complex:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you had radioactive iodine treatment or surgery and are now on levothyroxine with stable levels, you are likely eligible</li>
<li>If you are currently taking methimazole or PTU, policies vary -- some centers accept these medications, others do not</li>
<li>If your thyroid levels are unstable or you are actively symptomatic, you will likely be deferred until stable</li>
</ul>

<p>For both conditions, the center will want to see that your thyroid function is well-controlled. Being on a stable dose of thyroid medication for at least 3 months with no recent dosage changes is generally favorable.</p>

<h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Verdict: Usually Disqualifying</h3>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is a <strong>permanent deferral</strong> at most plasma centers due to the autoimmune nature and insulin dependence.</p>
</div>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It is generally a permanent deferral for plasma donation for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Autoantibodies:</strong> Type 1 diabetes involves anti-GAD antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies, and anti-islet cell antibodies that circulate in the plasma</li>
<li><strong>Insulin dependence:</strong> All Type 1 diabetics require insulin, and the use of insulin is itself a deferral factor at many centers due to the risk of hypoglycemic episodes during donation</li>
<li><strong>Blood sugar stability:</strong> The plasmapheresis process can affect blood sugar levels, creating safety risks for the donor</li>
<li><strong>Vascular concerns:</strong> Long-standing Type 1 diabetes can affect blood vessels, potentially complicating the donation process</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Type 2 diabetes (which is not autoimmune) has different rules. Type 2 diabetics who are well-controlled and do not use insulin may be accepted at some centers. See our <a href="/blog/can-diabetics-donate-plasma-2026.html">complete guide to diabetes and plasma donation</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="medications">Medications That Disqualify You</h2>

<p>Even if your autoimmune condition might otherwise be acceptable, specific medications will trigger a deferral. Here is a comprehensive list of the most common disqualifying drug classes used to treat autoimmune diseases:</p>

<h3>Biologic Medications (Always Disqualifying)</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Drug Name</th><th>Brand Name</th><th>Used For</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Adalimumab</td><td>Humira</td><td>RA, Crohn's, UC, psoriasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>Etanercept</td><td>Enbrel</td><td>RA, psoriasis, AS</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<h3>Non-Biologic Immunosuppressants (Usually Disqualifying)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Methotrexate:</strong> Used for RA, psoriasis, Crohn's -- always disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Azathioprine (Imuran):</strong> Used for IBD, lupus, many other conditions -- always disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Mycophenolate (CellCept):</strong> Used for lupus, vasculitis -- always disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Cyclosporine:</strong> Used for severe psoriasis, RA -- always disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Tacrolimus (Prograf):</strong> Used for various autoimmune conditions -- always disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Leflunomide (Arava):</strong> Used for RA -- disqualifying with long washout period</li>
</ul>

<h3>JAK Inhibitors (Always Disqualifying)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tofacitinib (Xeljanz):</strong> Used for RA, UC, psoriatic arthritis</li>
<li><strong>Upadacitinib (Rinvoq):</strong> Used for RA, UC, Crohn's, atopic dermatitis</li>
<li><strong>Baricitinib (Olumiant):</strong> Used for RA</li>
</ul>

<h3>Corticosteroids (Depends on Dose)</h3>

<p>Corticosteroids like prednisone occupy a gray area. Policies vary by center, but general guidelines include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low-dose prednisone (under 10mg/day):</strong> May be accepted at some centers</li>
<li><strong>High-dose prednisone (10mg+ daily):</strong> Usually disqualifying</li>
<li><strong>Short courses (burst and taper):</strong> May require a waiting period after completing the course</li>
<li><strong>Topical steroids:</strong> Generally accepted -- not a systemic medication</li>
<li><strong>Inhaled steroids:</strong> Generally accepted for asthma -- not the same as systemic immunosuppression</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medications That Are Usually OK</h3>

<p>Not all medications for autoimmune-adjacent conditions are disqualifying:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Levothyroxine (Synthroid):</strong> Thyroid hormone replacement -- accepted</li>
<li><strong>NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen):</strong> Anti-inflammatory, not immunosuppressive -- accepted</li>
<li><strong>Mesalamine (Asacol, Lialda):</strong> For IBD -- usually accepted</li>
<li><strong>Topical corticosteroid creams:</strong> For skin conditions -- accepted</li>
<li><strong>Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil):</strong> Policies vary -- some centers accept it, others do not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="center-policies">Center-by-Center Policies</h2>

<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of autoimmune eligibility is that policies differ between plasma companies. What gets you deferred at one center may be accepted at another. Here is what to expect at the major chains:</p>

<h3>General Policy Comparison</h3>

<table><thead><tr><th>Center</th><th>Autoimmune Approach</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CSL Plasma</td><td>Conservative</td><td>Strict on most autoimmune diagnoses; medication review thorough</td></tr>
<tr><td>BioLife (Takeda)</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Case-by-case for mild conditions; follows FDA guidance closely</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octapharma</td><td>Moderate</td><td>May accept some controlled conditions; individual screening</td></tr>
<tr><td>BPL Plasma</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Evaluates on case-by-case basis</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grifols</td><td>Conservative</td><td>Tends to err on the side of caution</td></tr>
<tr><td>KEDPLASMA</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Individual evaluation; may accept stable thyroid conditions</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Even within the same company, individual center medical directors can have slightly different interpretations of policy. The screening physician or nurse practitioner at your specific location makes the final call. This means it is sometimes worth visiting a different location of the same company if you are deferred at one.</p>

<h3>What Happens at Screening</h3>

<p>When you visit a plasma center for the first time, you will go through a medical screening that includes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Health history questionnaire:</strong> This asks about all medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases</li>
<li><strong>Medication review:</strong> You will list every medication, supplement, and over-the-counter drug you take</li>
<li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> A brief exam checks vital signs, veins, and general health</li>
<li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> Hemoglobin, total protein, and screening for infectious diseases</li>
<li><strong>Medical staff review:</strong> A physician or qualified medical professional reviews your history and makes the eligibility determination</li>
</ol>

<p>Be completely honest during this process. Lying about an autoimmune diagnosis or medication is dangerous -- it puts plasma recipients at risk and can result in permanent banning from all plasma centers if discovered.</p>

<h2 id="rejected">What to Do If You Are Rejected</h2>

<p>Being told you cannot donate plasma because of an autoimmune condition is disappointing, especially if you were counting on the income. Here are your options:</p>

<h3>1. Ask for Specifics</h3>

<p>When you are deferred, ask the medical staff exactly why. Was it the diagnosis itself, a specific medication, or an abnormal lab result? Understanding the specific reason helps you know if there is any path forward.</p>

<h3>2. Try a Different Center</h3>

<p>If your condition is in the gray area (mild psoriasis, stable thyroid disease, diet-controlled celiac), it is worth trying a different plasma center or a different company. Policies genuinely differ, and a different medical director may have a different interpretation.</p>

<h3>3. Ask About Medication Changes</h3>

<p>Talk to your doctor -- not to stop or change medications for the purpose of donating plasma (that would be medically irresponsible), but to understand if you might be transitioning to a different treatment that happens to be more compatible with donation. Never alter your treatment plan without your doctor's guidance.</p>

<h3>4. Check Back After Remission</h3>

<p>Some conditions go through periods of remission where you may be off medication. If you achieve sustained remission and discontinue immunosuppressant medications (under your doctor's supervision), your eligibility may change. There is typically a washout period required after stopping medications before you can donate.</p>

<h3>5. Explore Specialized Plasma Programs</h3>

<p>Some pharmaceutical companies run specialized programs that specifically collect plasma from people with certain autoimmune conditions. Your autoantibodies, which disqualify you from standard donation, may actually be valuable for research and diagnostic test development. Ask your rheumatologist or specialist about these opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternative Ways to Help (and Earn)</h2>

<p>If standard plasma donation is not an option, there are other ways to contribute to medical science and potentially earn compensation:</p>

<h3>Clinical Trials</h3>

<p>Clinical trials for autoimmune diseases often compensate participants and may specifically seek people with your condition. Resources to find trials include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ClinicalTrials.gov:</strong> The U.S. government database of all registered clinical trials -- search by your condition</li>
<li><strong>Your specialist's office:</strong> Rheumatologists, neurologists, and gastroenterologists often know about local trials</li>
<li><strong>University medical centers:</strong> Academic hospitals frequently run research studies</li>
<li><strong>Patient advocacy organizations:</strong> Groups like the Lupus Foundation, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, and National MS Society maintain trial listings</li>
</ul>

<p>Compensation for clinical trials varies widely -- from nothing to several thousand dollars depending on the study requirements.</p>

<h3>Biobank Donations</h3>

<p>Some research biobanks collect blood and tissue samples from people with autoimmune diseases specifically for research purposes. These samples help scientists understand autoimmune mechanisms and develop new treatments. Compensation is usually modest (typically $25-$100 per sample), but the time commitment is minimal.</p>

<h3>Whole Blood Donation</h3>

<p>Interestingly, some people who cannot donate plasma can still donate whole blood through organizations like the American Red Cross. The eligibility criteria for whole blood are different because the blood is used differently. However, many of the same medication restrictions apply. Check with your local blood bank.</p>

<h3>Other Income Alternatives</h3>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with an autoimmune disease?</h3>
<p>Most autoimmune diseases disqualify you from donating plasma. Conditions like lupus, MS, and Type 1 diabetes are almost always a permanent deferral. However, mild or well-controlled conditions like celiac disease managed by diet, mild psoriasis with topical treatment only, or stable Hashimoto's thyroiditis on levothyroxine may be accepted at certain centers on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Why does autoimmune disease disqualify you from plasma donation?</h3>
<p>Autoimmune diseases cause your immune system to produce abnormal antibodies that attack your own tissues. These antibodies circulate in your plasma and could potentially harm a recipient who receives plasma-derived products. Additionally, most immunosuppressant medications used to treat autoimmune diseases are disqualifying because they can also end up in the donated plasma.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma if you have lupus?</h3>
<p>No. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a permanent deferral at virtually all plasma donation centers. Lupus produces a wide range of autoantibodies that make your plasma unsafe for therapeutic use. This applies regardless of how well-controlled your lupus is or whether you are currently in remission.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with rheumatoid arthritis?</h3>
<p>It depends on your treatment. Mild RA managed only with NSAIDs like ibuprofen may be accepted at some centers. However, if you take methotrexate, biologics like Humira or Enbrel, or other immunosuppressants, you will be deferred. Each center evaluates RA on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with psoriasis?</h3>
<p>Mild psoriasis treated only with topical creams may be accepted at some plasma centers. However, moderate to severe psoriasis requiring systemic medications like methotrexate or biologics like Cosentyx or Skyrizi will disqualify you. The key factor is your medication, not just the diagnosis.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with celiac disease?</h3>
<p>Often yes. Celiac disease managed with a gluten-free diet alone, with no active symptoms, is accepted at many plasma centers. Since celiac is controlled through diet rather than immunosuppressant medications, it is one of the autoimmune conditions most likely to be approved. Watch for anemia, which can cause temporary deferral.</p>

<h3>Can you donate plasma with Hashimoto's thyroiditis?</h3>
<p>Possibly. If your Hashimoto's is well-controlled with thyroid hormone replacement like levothyroxine and your thyroid levels are stable, some centers will accept you. Levothyroxine is not an immunosuppressant, so it does not trigger a medication deferral. However, policies vary by center, so call ahead to confirm.</p>

<h3>What medications disqualify you from donating plasma?</h3>
<p>Common disqualifying medications for autoimmune conditions include biologics (Humira, Enbrel, Remicade, Cosentyx), methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), mycophenolate (CellCept), cyclosporine, tacrolimus, JAK inhibitors (Xeljanz, Rinvoq), and high-dose corticosteroids like prednisone above 10mg daily. Topical medications and thyroid hormones are generally accepted.</p>
