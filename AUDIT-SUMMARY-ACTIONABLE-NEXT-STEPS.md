## The Financial Impact

### Conservative Estimate (If you create 35 posts)

**Assumptions:**
- 2,000 new monthly impressions per 5 posts
- 2-3% CTR from these new pages
- $2 AdSense RPM

**Calculation:**
- 7 groups of 5 posts = 14,000 monthly impressions
- 14,000 x 2.5% CTR = 350 clicks
- 350 clicks x $2 RPM = $700/month new revenue

**Timeline:** 3-4 months to see full impact

### Aggressive Estimate (If you create all 69 posts)

**Assumptions:**
- Same metrics as above
- Some content compounds (topic authority benefit)
- Internal linking boosts existing content

**Calculation:**
- 99,100 potential searches
- Realistically capture 15-20% = 15,000-20,000 monthly impressions
- 15,000-20,000 x 2-3% CTR = 300-600 clicks
- 300-600 clicks x $2 RPM = $600-1,200/month new revenue

**Plus:** Existing content may see 10-20% traffic boost from topic authority
- Current $90/month + 15% boost = $100-105
- New content: $600-1,200
- **Total potential: $700-1,305/month** (vs. current $90)

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong?

1. **Content quality suffers if posting too fast**

   - Solution: Use proper canonical tags (already in place)
   - Recommendation: Only link to different pages

5. **Google penalizes for low-quality content**
   - Solution: Maintain 2,000+ word count minimum
   - Recommendation: Use checklist before publishing
